<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Recent</span> discoveries in the Roman Forum have
brought to light many interesting relics. Amongst
these are the statues of the Vestales Maximæ, of which,
in spite of the efforts of the lime-burners and stone-cutters
of the Middle Ages, who were distinguished for
their work of wholesale destruction, thirty-six inscriptions,
and fourteen statues, have been discovered.</p>

<p>The pedestals on which the statues were placed
bear inscriptions, and the names of the Vestales
Maximæ whose virtues are recorded.</p>

<p>There is one exception&mdash;the name is carefully
erased&mdash;and we can know her of whom so much is
said in praise, only as <i>Number Thirteen</i>.</p>

<p>An attempt has been made to clothe the memory
of this Vestal with some probable, though of course
wholly fictitious, incidents; and to assume as a certainty
the idea, which has been thrown out as a possibility,
that her conversion to Christianity was discovered,
and that one in authority desired to leave
no trace of her family or her name to future generations.</p>

<p>But, though her name has perished, her virtues
remain engraven on the imperishable stone, and these
help us to call her before us, in all the grace and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
dignity of a beautiful life, passed in the cloisters of
the Vestals&#8217; home.</p>

<p>The incidents which have gathered round her supposed
history, are more or less connected with the
persecution and martyrdom of the Early Church in
Britain, and afterwards in Rome.</p>

<p>A glance like this into the past may be made useful
to the young reader, if it should quicken a desire
for the intelligent study of history, and help the student
to look upon the events of bygone ages as they affected
real men and women, who had the same hopes and
fears, and aims and ends, as we have, who are living
so long after them.</p>

<p>We are, naturally perhaps, too apt to think of
those of whom we read in these distant ages, as myths
rather than as the brothers and sisters of the one
great family of God, to which we all belong. Their
human hearts beat with the same affections as ours,
and through the mists of superstition and ignorance
the lamp of an undying love shines out here and there,
as a light in a dark place.</p>

<p>Thus, through the symbol of the sacred fire, which
the Vestals vowed to keep for ever burning, we may
see the foreshadowing of the mission of every Christian
woman, matron or maiden, whose high vocation it
is to keep the light of truth, purity, and love, for ever
burning in her daily life, and by giving light to those
around fulfil the command of her Master, when He
said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let your light so shine before men, that they
may see your good works, and glorify your Father
which is in heaven.&#8221;</p>

<small>A SILENT CITY.</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was silence in the city of Verulam on a
bright summer day now nearly sixteen hundred years
ago. It was a strange silence which reigned in the
deserted streets of the old Roman city, which, with its
baths and public buildings, was reckoned one of the
finest in that sea-girt island, which the mistress of the
world had made her own.</p>

<p>A vast crowd had left the city gates at dawn on
that cloudless morning of early summer; women and
children, stately matrons and tender maidens, all
poured out of the town towards a river, some in
chariots, many on foot, but all eager to get a good
position on a flower-covered hill where a scene which
would fill their hearts with an unhealthful excitement
was to be enacted. For many of the Roman ladies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
who wore costly robes, and fared delicately, and were
at once the envy and admiration of the Britons, had
inherited for the most part the passion for a sight
which would now blanch the cheeks of their descendants,
and fill their hearts with horror and shame.</p>

<p>There are exceptions to every rule, and though at
a first glance the city looked entirely deserted, business
and pleasure alike stopped, and the forum and
temples empty, yet from one or two of the houses of
the higher class of Roman nobility the inhabitants
had not gone forth with the multitude, but had
preferred remaining at home.</p>

<p>The villa of the noble Roman, Severus, was one
of these; it was built, like all Roman houses, round a
square, which was open to the sky above. A fountain
played in the centre, and round the marble basin were
planted the golden iris with its long-pointed leaves,
and palms with their fan-like foliage; while the water-lilies,
just opening their rounded buds, were rocking
on the water, as it rose and fell with a gentle
splash, pleasant to the ear and soothing to the spirit.</p>

<p>Couches covered with rich stuffs were arranged
round this outer hall or &#8220;atrium,&#8221; and on one of them
a lady was reclining; a little maiden of eleven years old
at her feet, and a slave standing by her side, with a
cup in one hand and a cloth in the other, fringed with
gold lace, with which she wiped the lips of her
mistress when she sipped the draught offered her,
after nibbling at a sweet hard cake which she held
in her hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>The early sunshine had not yet come into the
court, and the lady said, shuddering&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Another scarf, Ebba, it is so cold. Ah, me! how
I long for the warmth of my own country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ebba placed the salver on a shelf which was just
behind the couch, and taking a rich violet mantle
from a carved chest threw it round her mistress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is thy master gone with the multitude, and has
he taken Casca with him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, lady, there is no one left in the house but
myself and the child Hyacintha.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the sound of her name the young girl looked
up. She had been so engrossed with a chain of
Venetian shells she was threading upon gold silk,
that she had apparently no thought for anything
besides.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother!&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;tell me about the sight
every one has gone forth to see. Why could I not go?
My father might have taken me with Casca.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, Hyacintha, the crowd would have been too
great. I dare not expose thee to its dangers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man who is to die is a very evil man, is he
not, mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, child, I have not heard so much said.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the fair-haired British Ebba turned towards
the child.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man is a good man,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He gave
bread to the hungry, he clothed the naked, and he
has perished because he would fain save the life of
his friend.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>&#8220;Ah, that is noble!&#8221; said the little maiden with a
light of interest kindled in her clear eyes. &#8220;Ah! that
is noble; why should he die?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou art too young, my daughter, to understand
the reason why a man like this Alban should die.
But the reason is good, nevertheless. The old faith
must be protected and defended, if it be possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ebba&#8217;s lips were seen to move, but no sound
passed them.</p>

<p>&#8220;These Christians,&#8221; the lady continued, &#8220;are trying
to upset, and pull down, and destroy our religion
and our worship; it is only meet that they should be
hindered from further mischief.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Ebba&#8217;s lips moved, and the child, looking
up, thought she caught the words&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;They cannot be hindered, for God is for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ebba is murmuring to herself, mother,&#8221; Hyacintha
said. &#8220;Bid her to speak so that we may hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the curtain which fell over the entrance to the
dining-hall was seen to quiver as the British slave-girl
disappeared behind it.</p>

<p>Then the lady exclaimed, &#8220;I wish Ebba would
take more heed of her ways, for if she is defiled with
the foreign superstitions, there will be trouble for us.
There is enough trouble as it is. Ah! me, why do
people make so much of religion? Jupiter or Apollo,
or the Christian&#8217;s God, it is all the same to me!&#8221;</p>

<p>And the lady leaned back upon her pillow, and
very soon the dark lashes were resting on her cheeks,
and she was wrapt in a gentle slumber.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>There are always people in all ages of the world
of the same easy temperament as this wife of the
noble Severus. The city might be deserted; the
rage of a tyrannical governor might vent itself on the
brave and loyal-hearted Alban, by torture and death,
but what did it concern Cæcilia?</p>

<p>As I said, many other ladies of her rank had gone
out that day to see the cruel sight, and to feast their
eyes on a scene from which delicately nurtured women
might have been supposed to turn with loathing. But
Cæcilia, the wife of Severus, hated trouble, and looking
on life as one long festival, disliked to think of
anything which seemed to point to the probability,
that to many it was a season of trial and suffering.
So, lulled by the fountain in the atrium of her husband&#8217;s
beautiful villa, she enjoyed a dreamy repose,
and was unconscious of all that was passing about her,
and that her little daughter had put aside the shells
and also disappeared behind the curtain.</p>

<p>Ebba was on the gallery that ran round the
atrium, and when she saw Hyacintha pull aside the
curtain she came to the head of the marble stairs, and
beckoned to her.</p>

<p>The child went up to her, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it you said, Ebba?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come hither and look from the gallery over the
country, and you will see.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she spoke, Ebba mounted still higher to the
square opening in the roof, on one side of which was
a small covered gallery, whence an extensive view was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
spread out, of the town and river and country beyond.
The child gazed upon the view before her with wistful,
questioning eyes.</p>

<p>The throng of people spread over the fields, which
were smiling in the June sunshine; and along the
great Watling Street, and across the bridge, there was
a continuous stream of all ages and sexes.</p>

<p>The low murmur of the moving multitude reached
the place where the Briton slave and her little mistress
stood, and upon a hill rising on the opposite bank by
the river there was an erection, round which the
glittering helmets of soldiers were shining in the sun.
Hyacintha drew closer to Ebba, and said, in a low
tone&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, Ebba, are they going to see the man
killed? I wish you would speak, and,&#8221; she murmured,
&#8220;tell me all you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were to tell you that,&#8221; the young Briton said,
&#8220;I should be seized and tortured; and I am not ready
to confess my faith.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thy faith? Is not thy faith to believe that the
gods are above, and watch over men; and that if men
and women submit to their decrees they are protected
and safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ebba shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know not if the Romans are safe under the
care of their gods. I know they have enslaved us
and are stern masters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I not kind to thee, Ebba?&#8221; said Hyacintha;
&#8220;I would fain be kind; but of late thou hast been so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
strange and sad. Never can I win a laugh from thee.
Never wilt thou play the harp for me to dance and
sing. Tell me all that is in thy heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ebba clasped her hands, and leaning upon the
balustrade she said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were brave, and not a coward, I should tell
thee all. Nay, I should tell the world; but I am a
coward, and I durst not.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hyacintha seated herself on one of the cushioned
seats on the balcony, while Ebba continued to look
out on the moving multitude and the distant hill, the
shining river and the sunny slopes around it, silently
and sadly.</p>

<p>Ebba was a large, strongly-built maiden of some
eighteen or twenty years. She had been born a slave
in the Roman&#8217;s household, and had never known any
other life. Her complexion was florid, and her hair
the richest auburn. She wore the badge of her master
on her arm; and her dress was of woollen material, girt
in at the waist by a band, but falling loosely to her
ankles.</p>

<p>Ebba was skilful and clever, and was a favourite
with her mistress, who had many attendants, but
always gave Ebba the preference. Time had been
when Ebba had been foremost in providing amusement,
for she could dance to the tambourine, and her
broad face was generally lighted by a smile.</p>

<p>She was quick in arranging flowers, in plaiting her
lady&#8217;s hair, and weaving into it coins and gold ornaments
with a skill which few could rival.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>Of late a change had passed over her, and instead
of a merry girl, who had a light jest and a sally for
every one, she was a grave, sad woman, often speaking
to herself in low tones, and taking no part in the
festive revelries of Severus&#8217;s household. The child
Hyacintha was, even at eleven years old, most unusually
beautiful. She was born of a patrician race
on both sides, and fulfilled all the conditions of her
noble birth in her form and features. Her figure, even
now, when childhood was passing into girlhood, was
lithe and supple, and the Roman maiden developed
early, for fourteen was considered as the entrance
into womanhood.</p>

<p>Hyacintha&#8217;s eyes were of that dusky hue which,
taking a new colour with every varying light, defies
description. Her hair was of a deep golden brown;
and though she had every distinctive feature of her
race in the well-cut features, and curved, short upper
lip, with rather a massive chin, her complexion was
fair.</p>

<p>Hyacintha had been born in the north during her
father&#8217;s first year of office about the person of the
Governor; thus the Italian sunshine had not given her
complexion the rich dark hue which characterised her
mother.</p>

<p>No one could look at Hyacintha, even at that early
age, without seeing that there was in her something
beyond the ordinary type of girlhood. Her mother
might dream away life, and know no higher pleasures
than the acquisition of beautiful dresses and ornaments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and in the entertainment of guests, and driving along
the level Watling Street in her well-appointed chariot,
but Hyacintha had already other aims and views.
The child had heard from her father that maidens of
their house had been chosen to keep the sacred fire
burning in the temple of Vesta&mdash;that fire which was
never to be quenched&mdash;that light which, coming from
heaven, was to keep the sacred flame alive in every
Roman&#8217;s hearth and heart!</p>

<p>Hyacintha would ask her mother many questions
about this temple, and the beautiful city so far away,
and when her mother complained of the chilling winds
and dark skies of the northern climate, she would
ask&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do we not return to Rome?&#8221;</p>

<p>The British slave-girl, Ebba, could tell her nothing
of that distant city; but of late, when she spoke of it,
she would speak of another city fairer and more beautiful
than Rome could be, and when Hyacintha asked
how people reached it, she would clasp her hands and
say&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;By a rough and terrible way, from which the
timid shrank, but the brave of heart went forth boldly
to tread.&#8221;</p>

<p>Several times in the course of that long summer&#8217;s
day did little Hyacintha mount to the balcony and
look out on the crowd which covered the hill-side.</p>

<p>Now and then a few stragglers returned, or a
chariot with prancing steeds rolled along the great
Watling Street.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>Women, tired of carrying their children, came
back to the city, and by the evening there were knots
of people in the city all talking of what had happened
on the hill above the river. Just at sunset the servants
of Severus&#8217;s household returned, and the evening
meal was laid in the inner hall or banqueting-room.
Very soon the wheels of chariots were heard rolling
up, and Hyacintha ran down to meet her father and
brother, and hear the news.</p>

<p>Severus had several officers and gentlemen with
him, and was scarcely conscious of his little daughter&#8217;s
presence till she pulled the sleeve of his robe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, father, is the man dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, little one, and so may all the enemies of the
gods perish. But such a story is not for thy ears, my
Hyacintha. See, take thy lute and play to us while
we sup. These fellows have had enough of freedom
for one day, and the supper is late. How now, slaves!&#8221;
Severus exclaimed, clapping his hands, &#8220;let the guests
be served.&#8221;</p>

<p>The couches were soon filled by the company, and
Cæcilia reclined at the head of the board, dressed in
the richest violet silk, with gold trimmings, a long
veil floating at the back of her head.</p>

<p>Ebba was in attendance, and a seat at the end of
the sofa or couch was reserved for Hyacintha.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where have you left Casca? Where is my son?&#8221;
Cæcilia asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;The boy is weary, and the day has been too
much for him. He has not the nerve and muscle of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Spartan,&#8221; was the reply; &#8220;not so much as our little
maiden here, I verily believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And, indeed,&#8221; said a grave man, who was one of
the guests, &#8220;it was a sight to affect a boy of your
son&#8217;s tender years.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Roman father laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, may he never see worse sights than that we
have witnessed to-day. There was not enough terror in
it; these miserable Christians need stronger discipline;
they are so stubborn. When the beasts spring on them
in the arena, and a huge leopard plays with one like a
ball, then it is somewhat thrilling, I grant, but to-day!
Fill the cups, and let us drink to the health of the
Governor, and pour out a libation to the gods in token
of gratitude that it has been given to us to crush out
another at least of these reptiles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, now,&#8221; said a young man, &#8220;you forget the
executioner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, so I did, that was a fine addition to the
scene. I could laugh now to think of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Severus saw that his little daughter was following
every word that was said with extreme earnestness,
and that Ebba, who was standing with a scent-bottle
and a large fan close to her mistress, was scanning the
face of the last speaker eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bid the musicians strike up,&#8221; Severus said; &#8220;our
talk is scarcely pleasant for ladies to hear. And then,
when we have had a good stirring melody, my little
daughter shall sing us a good-night strain on her lute.
Eh, my pretty one?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>&#8220;Father, I pray you to excuse me to-night,&#8221;
Hyacintha said; &#8220;I am weary, and I have no heart to
sing.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stepped down from her place on her mother&#8217;s
couch, and with a curtsey, and graceful wave of her
hand to the guests at the table, disappeared.</p>

<small>NIGHT.</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> Casca and Hyacintha were their parents&#8217;
only children, there were no very intimate relations
existing between them.</p>

<p>Casca was almost entirely at the schools, where
he was preparing for active service, and receiving such
training as was deemed needful for a young Roman.
His father was disappointed that his only boy should
be pale and delicate, that his arms should not be
muscular, and that he was always at fault in any
game, or trial of strength. Severus did his best to
harden his only son, and it was with that idea that he
had taken him with him that morning to see the execution
of Alban.</p>

<p>Severus was in attendance on the Governor, and,
shrinking and frightened, the boy stood by his father&#8217;s
side, hiding his face in his short toga, when the
martyr was scourged till the ground was moistened
with his blood. Judge and Governor alike were pitiless,
and, believing they were performing an act of service
to their gods by crushing out the confessors of the
Christian faith in Verulam, they were determined to
make the whole scene as impressive as possible.</p>

<p>Alban was no common man: it was necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
that his execution should be conducted in no ordinary
fashion.</p>

<p>He had lived in one of the finest villas in the city,
he was a learned scholar, and had unquestioned taste
in the fine arts which the Romans were introducing
into Britain.</p>

<p>Although born at Verulam, Alban had, in his
youth, travelled to Rome, and when he returned had
been looked upon with veneration and respect. Although
a Pagan, and scrupulous in his attendance on
all high ceremonies in the temple of the gods, Alban
had always been charitable and compassionate, and
the poor found in him a friend.</p>

<p>Thus, full of kindness, when the Emperor&#8217;s edict
published against the Christians at Rome and in all
Roman provinces was issued, Alban opened his house
to a man who was fleeing from his persecutors, and
a minister of the religion of Christ. This was the
turning-point of Alban&#8217;s life; this was the first step to
the martyrdom which he had suffered gladly on this
summer day for the faith of Christ crucified.</p>

<p>It is hard for us to realise, or grasp as facts, the
terrible persecutions of those distant times.</p>

<p>Perhaps nothing is a stronger testimony to the
Christian faith than that the more it was attacked, and
the fiercer the persecution of its disciples, the more it
grew and strengthened.</p>

<p>It has been so in all times; it will be so in all
future ages, &#8220;for the Lord remaineth a King for
ever.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>Hyacintha went to find her brother. The child&#8217;s
head was filled with a strange yearning curiosity to
know all particulars of what had passed.</p>

<p>She went up the marble staircase once more, and
again looked out from the balcony over the city and
the country.</p>

<p>The western sky was still aglow, and the outline
of the hill was marked against it in purple lines. The
river caught a reflection from a crescent moon which
hung above it, and rippled in the silvery light.</p>

<p>The country beyond the city was asleep, but the
city, which had been so quiet in the morning, was
now astir. The buzz and murmur of voices rose on
the still air, and slaves were seen conducting Roman
citizens of note to their homes. Torches were lighted,
silver lamps burning in the &#8220;Halls,&#8221; while strains of
music and the voices of singing girls were borne on
the breath of the evening air.</p>

<p>But Hyacintha did not stay on the balcony long;
she turned from it to a room on the opposite side of
the square opening, where she knew she should find
her brother.</p>

<p>She went softly round to the doorway, and gently
clapped her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Enter!&#8221; was said in a low voice; &#8220;is that you,
Claudius?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Casca, it is only Hyacintha;&#8221; and Hyacintha
pushed back the curtain and stood half shyly by her
brother&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>He had thrown himself down on a couch, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
hands folded behind his head, and his whole attitude
one of extreme weariness.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want, Hyacintha?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want news,&#8221; she replied; &#8220;tell me what you
have seen to-day. Do tell me all the truth about the
death of the evil man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Casca sprang up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush! Do not speak of that you know not, child.
Evil, forsooth! he was good, not evil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what I want to be sure of. Be kind,
brother, be kind, and tell me the story.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Casca sank back again upon his cushion, and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to-night. I shall never sleep if I rehearse it.
I could not go over it again. Who are below?&#8221; he
asked, as the sounds of music and singing came from
the atrium.</p>

<p>&#8220;A few guests, some that my father brought home;
no ladies but my mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is not Junia there, the sister of Claudius?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, unless she has arrived since I left the banqueting-hall.
I would not stay, though father prayed
me to sing to the lute. I could not stay, because I
wanted to find thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear little sister,&#8221; Casca said, &#8220;I would not be
rough to thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou art never rough, brother,&#8221; was the answer,
&#8220;and I love thee dearly. I only wish I knew more of
thy secrets. May I stay with thee?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, draw that stool to the window, and pull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the curtain aside. I like to see the sky and the
stars.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hyacintha obeyed, and waited for what her brother
would say next; he was contemplating the graceful
outline of her head against the sky, as, with her elbow
on the deep stone ledge of the window, her cheek
resting upon her hand, she made a study any artist
might long to put on canvas. Hyacintha waited patiently
for her brother to speak, and at last he broke
the silence, though not in the way she expected.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a bitter disappointment to our father, Hyacintha,
a poor, puny weakling like me; there are times
when I long for death, to be free of this life. It may
be that the gods would be merciful to me and give
me the strength hereafter I lack here. But to-day,
when I saw death, I shuddered and swooned. I am
a wretched coward, with no power to live, and no
power to die.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hyacintha&#8217;s eyes filled with tears. What comfort
had a heathen to offer in all these exigencies of life
and death? What could Hyacintha say to throw any
light or hope over her brother&#8217;s darkness? Though but
a child, she had heard much, from the grown-up
people with whom she associated, of the world, and
the pleasures of dance and song, and the games and
all the luxuries and refinements of life, which were
supposed to be a cure for heart-aches and trials. But
Ebba had talked of feeding the hungry, nursing the
sick, and clothing the naked, as a way to be happy.
She said this man, Alban, had done these things, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
that there was always a light on his face which was
not shed there by any of the pleasures in which others
indulged. Poor Hyacintha&#8217;s mind was all confused
and bewildered; she almost wished she could be gay
and careless like Junia, whose voice, singing a familiar
song, now sounded from the atrium.</p>

<p>She began dimly to grasp the fact that something
was wanted to make life different from the life her
mother led, and many ladies, who frequented the
atrium and lay on the luxurious couches there, and
toyed with their bracelets and ornaments.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will pray my father,&#8221; Hyacintha thought &#8220;that
I may go to Rome, and be trained for a priestess, in
the temple of Vesta. Yes, I will pray him that I may
do this, then I shall be happier far, for it will be doing
something grand and noble.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her meditations were a second time broken in
upon by her brother&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark! I think I hear Claudius&#8217;s footstep. Yes;
run, Hyacintha, and admit him.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Claudius did not wait to be admitted. He
came springing in with a light step, and a cheery
voice, a voice that had laughter in it, like the ripple
of a brook hidden amongst moss and stones.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, here you are, hiding and moping! Wherefore
such dolorous looks, young Casca? I am in the highest
spirits. What think you? I am chosen for the race
to-morrow, and I will win, too. Your pardon, fair Hyacintha.
I did not perceive you in the shadow of the
curtain. What ails you, Casca?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>&#8220;Weariness of myself and life, that is all,&#8221; the boy
said; &#8220;you are in its full zest and enjoyment, while
I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pish! what folly! The best time is coming. Why,
as soon as you wear the toga virilis you will feel the
man. Were you on the hill to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I was <i>forced</i> to be there by my father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forced! Well, it was a fine spectacle; though to
say the truth, there&#8217;s many a worse fellow than Alban
about the city. Those sly Christians are doing secretly
here in Verulam what Alban did openly, there&#8217;s the
difference. They may be unearthed any day, and the
sooner the better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know the whole story,&#8221; Hyacintha said.
&#8220;I pray you, Claudius, tell it to me. If I ask my father
he puts me off; and my mother says it is only that
some wicked men should be got rid of. And Ebba
is full of mystery, and sighs and mutters, but will not
speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will speak, if so it pleases you, little Hyacintha,&#8221;
said Claudius, &#8220;and tell what there is to be told, always
providing that I agree with your lady mother,
the sooner the reptiles are crushed out the better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will find a draught in yonder cup,&#8221; Casca
said, raising himself lazily on one arm; &#8220;that will refresh
you before you begin.&#8221; Claudius soon trained
the contents of the cup, and then replenished it from
a flagon which stood by it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, that is like nectar,&#8221; he said. Then he threw
his large muscular limbs upon some cushions piled up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
in a corner near the window, where Hyacintha sat,
her figure a little bent forward, and her eyes fastened
upon the boy, as he began his tale.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a few months ago, Alban was one of the
most devoted worshippers in the temple of Apollo.
He spent large sums on sacrifices, and if he poured
out a libation, it was of the purest wine. There was
no stint with him, as you know, or ought to know. A
man who professed to teach and preach this new
superstition was fleeing from his pursuers. Walking
along Watling Street, Alban, noticing his breathless
condition, inquired what ailed him. He said the
Governor&#8217;s minions were upon him. Alban, struck
with the man&#8217;s agony, hastily conducted him to his
house, and harboured him there in secret.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is said that the miserable fugitive prayed night
and day to his God, asking for help, and also that
Alban should be turned from the old faith to believe
these lies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you&mdash;is any one&mdash;sure they <i>are</i> lies?&#8221; Casca
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look you, Casca,&#8221; said Claudius, &#8220;it is not for
any one here to ask that question. Suffice it, that
they are lies, base lies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Casca sighed heavily, and Claudius continued&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fugitive, whose name was Amphibalus, at last
succeeded in his base designs. Alban, whom every
one respected and honoured here, professed himself a
Christian, and then the scene changed. So well had
Alban hidden this fellow, that it was not for many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
days that suspicion was directed to his house. When
at least it was searched, he, the stranger, had fled.
Alban had give him one of his best robes, and wearing
that, he escaped suspicion, and passed through
the gates. But Alban himself, clothed in the Caracalla,
which is the robe the fellow wore, was now under
suspicion. &#8216;You will suffer in his stead, unless
you at once sacrifice to the images of the gods,&#8217; the
judge said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To tell the truth,&#8221; said Claudius, &#8220;there was
something noble in the fellow, for no tortures could
make him give in. Hush! what is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>A low voice was heard to say&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Greater love hath no man than this, that he lay
down his life for his friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is Ebba&#8217;s voice,&#8221; Hyacintha exclaimed, and
running towards the door, she found Ebba standing
there.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is Ebba,&#8221; Hyacintha repeated. &#8220;Permit her to
enter and hear the story to the end.&#8221; Casca nodded
his head by way of assent, and Ebba, leaning against
the wall over which a curtain hung, listened intently
while Claudius finished his story.</p>

<p>&#8220;No tortures,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;would make the
fellow give in. The scourge ploughed his back pretty
well. He had thirty-nine stripes, and we expected to
see him fall down dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you in the hall?&#8221; Casca exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I have seen the whole play played out,&#8221; the
boy said carelessly. &#8220;The grand climax was to-day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
when the executioner threw himself at Alban&#8217;s feet,
and begged to die with him, or for him. And then
there was an uproar indeed. A great multitude pressed
round Alban, who was praying and calling upon his
God, and crying to Jesus to have mercy, and turn the
hearts of the people to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;The governor and judge, however, made short
work. A new executioner, one of the soldiers, was
easily found, and it was not long before the heads of
both Alban and Heraclius were rolling on the turf,
and their blood sprinkled on the flowers. But they
say in the city to-night that there are many who are
full of this superstition, and that there will be many
more. Thank the gods I am not one!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ebba, who had been standing motionless by the
door, murmured something, which was not distinctly
heard, and then vanished.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe Ebba is one of them,&#8221; Casca said. &#8220;If
it is so, it will bring us all into trouble, and my father
ought to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, a truce to the poor wretches. Now,&#8221; said
Claudius, &#8220;let us talk of other things. Ah! here is
Ebba with the light. She will not leave us in darkness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ebba did not speak, but lighted the two hanging
lamps, which cast a soft radiance on the room, and on
those who were in it. The beautiful childlike face of
Hyacintha was brought out from the shadows, and
large tears were seen upon her cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not tell father, dear brother,&#8221; she said, &#8220;about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Ebba. I pray you, do not. It might end in her death.
And, oh!&#8221; exclaimed Hyacintha passionately, &#8220;I do
dread death, the darkness whither we must go, before
we reach the Elysian fields.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not fret, little sister. You are too grave for
your tender years; come, sing to me and Claudius
the good-night song you refused to sing to the guests
below.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! sing to us, and then I must seek for my
sister, and conduct her home. The guests are leaving
the hall, some of them are hilarious enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke, loud laughter ascended from the
atrium, and the torches which the attendants and
slaves lifted flashed through the street. There was
not much need of their light this evening. The days
of our northern climate were at their longest, and almost
before daylight faded from the west, streaks of
dawn brightened the east.</p>

<p>The people of Verulam had gone through a tiring
day, and the city was wrapt earlier than usual in repose.</p>

<p>It was just between midnight and the first hour of
the coming day that a figure, veiled closely, glided
across the square, which lay on one side of the villa
Severus, and following the course of the river crossed
it towards the hill, where the great spectacle of the
day before had been witnessed by so many thousands.
These were for the most part sleeping peacefully in
Verulam, but some were yet watching on the spot
where the martyrs had shed their blood.</p>

<p>One of them was the priest whose life Alban had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
saved at the expense of his own, and as the dark-veiled
figure crept up the hill-side he advanced to
meet it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it thou, my daughter, Ebba, the slave of the
Roman house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, father, and I would fain follow thee. I am
not afraid now. I will confess Christ before men. If
I am to die, He will be with me, and I cannot&mdash;I dare
not&mdash;tarry any longer. Baptise me; I am ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Art thou sure thou art in truth ready to leave all
for Christ, to dare to confess thy faith?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s lips faltered, and she said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would fain remain with my mistress if it were
possible. I love her little daughter so well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! I see, thou art <i>not</i> ready to leave all for
Christ. There must be no halting between two
opinions. My daughter, he who was done to a cruel
death on this spot to-day, and whose blessed body we
have buried here in silence and darkness, did not
halt. Never can I forget the decision he showed. In
the very hour that he believed, he confessed, and gave
up all. Think what a renunciation it was: his fine
house, whither the noblest and the most learned scholars
amongst the Romans resorted; the honour paid him
when he went to the temple to sacrifice to the false
gods; the respect also felt for his gifts and talents.
Yet he never faltered, and when the great trial-hour
came he sent me forth in his robe, with a face as glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
as if, when he arrayed himself in my Caracalla,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> he
had donned his wedding garment.</p>

<p>&#8220;That robe was the signal for his death. He did
not fear to die for Christ, and he stood before the
Governor, so those tell me who saw him, with a face
shining like that of an angel. I have been in hiding
near by, and have remained under cover of the darkness,
to make known to the faithful whither I am gone,
that they may perchance follow me, and in the fastnesses
of Wales, we may add daily to our number
such as shall be saved. Say, Ebba, wilt thou follow?
See, there are signs of dawn in the east. I may not
tarry. That group yonder seen in dark, dim, outline,
is composed of those who are following me to a meeting-place
I have indicated. Wilt thou join thyself to
them?&#8221;</p>

<p>The poor British slave bowed her head, and clasping
her hands, said, &#8220;I will follow thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the priest led her to a spring, and baptised
the heathen Ebba by the name &#8220;Anna.&#8221;</p>

<p>The morning star was shining brightly, and the
summer dawn breaking over the hills, when, by the
grave of the two martyrs, the cross was signed upon
the forehead of the British slave.</p>

<p>The ceremony was performed in haste, and then
the little band dispersed, to escape observation, some
in one direction, some in another, but all to meet in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
a thick wood, near a place called Radburn, three
miles distant from the city of Verulam.</p>


<p>Ebba, or Anna, as we must now call her, was
committed to the care of a recent convert, named
Agatha, who had concealed a little band of Christians
in her house in the city, and who was an aunt to
the soldier who had thrown away his sword and died
rather than execute the savage commands of the
Governor and Judge. There was no time for many
words. Agatha kissed Anna on the forehead and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I welcome thee, my daughter, to the inheritance
of the saints, be it death or be it life.&#8221; And then in
silence the two women pursued their way through
the flower-scented meadow-land, and reached the
shelter of the tangled wood at Radburn before the
sun rose.</p>

<p>A cave in this wood, the mouth of which was
covered with brushwood, was the appointed meeting-place.
Here Amphibalus the priest had been hiding
since Alban had permitted him to escape. And here,
worn out with the events of the previous day, on beds
made of dry leaves and heather, Anna lay down with
her new friend to rest.</p>

<p>The cave was of some extent, and had several
divisions. A fissure in the rock above lighted the
inner part, which was allotted to the women. Even in
summer it was a cold habitation, and only when the
sun was high in the heavens could any warmth and
cheerfulness penetrate it. As Anna lay gazing up into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the roof, she could see the blue sky far above her
through the interlacing boughs of brambles, and low-growing
maples which grew over the opening.</p>

<p>The thrushes were singing their morning song,
and there was innumerable chirping of newly-fledged
birds, while the lowing of distant cattle and the
nearer humming of bees, kept up a continuous low
murmur.</p>

<p>Poor Anna could not sleep; she was thinking over
the life in the Roman villa, of all the little offices it
would soon be time to perform for her mistress and
for Hyacintha. She knew full well that she would be
missed before long, and perhaps pursued and found.
That punishment, if not death, was the doom of the
escaped slave, she knew well. The band, the badge
of that slavery, was still on her arm, and could only
be taken off by the hand of a smith. It would betray
her as the runaway slave of the noble Severus, though
the cross, the sign of her new faith, was invisible to
all eyes but the angels.</p>

<p>Anna&#8217;s was not a strong, heroic soul; she was, as
she had told her little mistress, a coward. &#8220;Yet He
giveth strength to the <i>weak</i>&#8221; was a promise to be fulfilled
in her case, as in that of the thousands who
have learned to &#8220;count all things but loss for the love
of Christ.&#8221;</p>

<p>Agatha was of a very different nature. She was
sleeping as soundly and quietly as a child, while her
young companion tossed and turned with wide-open
eyes and restless limbs till noonday was near. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
outer caves were getting full, and the whispers of the
fugitives awoke Agatha.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you slept, my daughter?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, I cannot sleep. I do not feel any peace,
though I would not go back if I could.&#8221; Then she
added hastily, and in a weak, low voice, &#8220;I am
hungry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Agatha smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; she said, &#8220;hunger and weariness are a
part of the cross we must bear after Christ; but
thou art young, my child, and I will see whether I can
find thee some food. We have had but scant measure
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Agatha disappeared within the outer cave, and
presently returned, beckoning Anna to follow her.</p>

<p>Awe-struck, the girl obeyed, and there, in the
outer cave, a little congregation was gathered round
Amphibalus, who was kneeling at a rude table formed
by a fragment of rock which blocked up the entrance
to the cavern.</p>

<p>At a sign from Agatha, Anna knelt with the rest,
and then Amphibalus rising, turned to the people,
and bade them draw near and receive the sign of
the love of the Crucified One, the bread and the wine
which He had commanded. In a few short words,
he rehearsed the story of the Cross to those poor
trembling converts who at any moment might be discovered
and dragged off to a cruel death. He told
of the life which now is, and that hope of the life to
come, as the blessed experience of the Christian, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
his anchor. For life here without Him is darkness,
and life there without Him is a dread void. What
did stripes and persecution weigh in the balance,
when the future exceeding glory and joy were on the
other side! Then he went on to speak of Alban, and
the soldier who died with him, rather than live without
him, and to bid all those present to encourage
each other in steadfastness and courage.</p>

<p>The Communion was then celebrated; the water
from a neighbouring spring, being coloured with wine
which Amphibalus had preserved in a small leathern
flask in a secret pocket of his robe, filled the rude cup
which was offered to the little band, and small fragments
of wheaten bread were eaten.</p>

<p>The command thus obeyed in all simplicity of faith
brought its blessing with it. Surely the strengthening
and refreshing of these fugitives were a great reality,
and poor Anna, rising from her knees with a smile on
her lips, whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will feed on Thee in my heart, O Saviour, and
I shall know neither hunger nor thirst.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was need of faith, for the bodies of the
little band were nearly exhausted before food came.
It was not till darkness covered the face of the country
that a messenger was sent to Radburn to buy bread.
He returned about midnight, with loaves concealed in
his clothes, and a pewter flagon or cup, that could be
filled from the spring, and was handed round.</p>

<p>When the bread was divided every one of the
fainting converts received the right share, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Amphibalus prayed for a blessing, and that this food
might support the bodies of those who partook of it
till more bountiful provision was vouchsafed.</p>

<p>A consultation was held as to the future, and it
was decided that the small band should remain in
hiding in the cave to await the coming in of any more
fugitives from the city.</p>

<p>Agatha, who was a strong and active woman,
busied herself in making the three caves more habitable,
by heaping up the heather and dried leaves for
beds, and plaiting some of it into small baskets, which
might be useful for exchanging for food whenever
there was any obtainable in their wanderings.</p>

<p>Wales was the probable destination of the little
community, where it was hoped they might find employment
as keepers of pigs and cattle, and in the
fastnesses of that district make converts from the
scanty population, and by degrees found a church
there.</p>

<p>Agatha&#8217;s cheerful, bright spirit infected Anna, and
she began to take heart, and as the Gospel story was
told her by her friend her soul expanded under its
influence, and she only longed that her dear little
mistress could have the same good news, and bitterly
repented that through fear and terror of the consequences
she had kept silence, and that she had not
answered many earnest questions that the child had
asked her.</p>

<p>It was too late now.</p>

<small>THE MISSING SLAVE.</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a good deal of consternation in the
household of the noble Severus when Ebba&#8217;s flight
was discovered.</p>

<p>An ominous frown upon Severus&#8217;s brow, as he
entered his wife&#8217;s chamber, showed that a storm was
brewing.</p>

<p>His lady had just had her morning bath, and was
crying in a very undignified way for Ebba, declaring
that the attendant, who was doing her best to supply
her place, scorched her head with the crimping iron;
that no one could plait her hair as Ebba did; that no
one could twist into it the gold threads, or place the
plait in the right position, but Ebba.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence!&#8221; exclaimed Severus; &#8220;what mean you, to
chide and wail like a weakling infant? Begone, all of
you,&#8221; he said, clapping his hands; &#8220;begone, slaves, nor
return till I bid you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The attendants, frightened by their master&#8217;s threatening
air, took flight like a flock of pigeons, and only
Hyacintha remained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didst hear my order, child?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Hyacintha, whose eyes were swollen with
weeping, said&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>&#8220;Father, do not send me hence, I pray you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Severus seldom said a harsh word to his little
daughter, and it was not often that she witnessed his
outbursts of passion.</p>

<p>He offered no opposition when Hyacintha nestled
closer to her mother on the couch, merely saying&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then hold your peace if you stay, nor make a
single objection to what I have to say. This slave,
Ebba, has, it seems, been in league with the poor
reptiles whom, by order of the Emperor, we are to do
our best to crush out of this land. By the gods! it is
no pleasant thing for me to have cold and scornful
looks turned on me in the Governor&#8217;s hall to-day; to
be suspected as the master of a household of these
creatures. &#8216;Forsooth,&#8217; one said in my ear, &#8216;the runaway
slave is not the only tainted one in thy house.&#8217;
I swear by the gods, that if he referred to my own
son, I will not spare him, no, I will deliver him up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hyacintha, who buried her face in her mother&#8217;s
mantle, gave a low cry of terror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Peace, child,&#8221; said her father; &#8220;I do not know if
Casca is infected, but I will take care to stop the infection
if it be so. I have set a price on Ebba&#8217;s
head, and do not doubt I shall scent her out; but it
is of this daughter of ours I wish to speak. I propose
to send her to Rome without delay, to begin her training
under our kinswoman, Terentia Rufilla. It is
time&mdash;high time&mdash;and I shall proceed at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cæcilia was not a mother to be too much concerned
about her child&#8217;s future. The loss of Ebba, which entailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
personal inconvenience, really distressed her more
than this proposed separation from her only daughter.
Hyacintha had for some time heard a rumour that
this office in the temple of the goddess Vesta was to
be her appointed lot. As, in later times, the daughters
of noble families were consigned to the convent, and
given no choice in the matter by their parents, but
compelled to take the veil, so, in the era of which I
write, there was no question as to the propriety of
devoting them to the service of Vesta, which was considered
the most honourable of all services connected
with the temples of the gods.</p>

<p>There were often difficulties in the way, as many
requirements had to be satisfied before a candidate
for the office was accepted, but Hyacintha could fulfil
these. She was of noble birth, and fair to look upon;
her disposition was gentle, and her temper sweet. She
had never rebelled against her parents&#8217; wishes in her
short life, and she was not likely to do so now. Indeed,
of late she had been herself looking forward to the
temple service; child as she was, she hungered for
service, to do some great and noble deed, and know
some higher life than that which the ladies about her
led, of feasting and song, of excessive ornaments and
luxurious plenty on the board of food and wine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Severus continued, &#8220;I can obtain an excellent
convoy for Hyacintha in the course of a few
days, and Casca shall accompany her. The family of
Burrhus are returning thither by way of Gaul with a
maniple. The Emperor has ordered their return, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Burrhus&#8217;s services are needed about Diocletian. His
wife will care for our little one, and she will be safe.
What sayest thou, Hyacintha, my fair blossom?&#8221;</p>

<p>The stern brow relaxed now, and the child saw it.
She stepped down from her mother&#8217;s couch, and going
to her father said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, I will go to be trained to serve in the
temple, though I grieve to leave thee and my mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Hyacintha,&#8221; exclaimed her mother, &#8220;thou
wert always strange in thy tastes. Even thy foster-mother
said thou never didst care for toys, and such
things as infants love. It will run through thy life,
methinks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had but Ebba. If I had&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Peace! no more of thy hankering for the slave.
I will let thee see her head when it is brought in. A
meek-faced hypocrite! I know her well,&#8221; said her
father.</p>

<p>&#8220;She was ever a helpful maiden to me, and I shall
want her sorely,&#8221; complained Cæcilia. &#8220;I pray she
may escape thy wrath. And be patient with Casca.
The boy has&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The boy has no strength of mind or body,&#8221; was
the answer, as Severus left the room.</p>

<p>Hyacintha summoned back the attendants at her
mother&#8217;s order, and listened for some time to a succession
of complaints and regrets for Ebba, which
apparently took as little effect on the other maidens as
the dropping of the water on the marble of the atrium
had upon the smooth polished surface.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>At length the toilette was completed, and the lady,
richly dressed, repaired to the public bath, which was
as much frequented in Verulam as in Rome. The
baths of these times answered to the fashionable clubs
and resorts of to-day. Acquaintances and friends met
there, discussed the news, expressed surprise at the
slow arrival of the post from Rome, one of the chief
stations for news being placed at Verulam, talked
gossip and scandal, as is the custom with unoccupied
women of every rank and every nation, in that time,
as in our own.</p>

<p>Cæcilia was accounted beautiful, and a person of
distinction. She was one of the leaders of fashion,
and her cosmetics and perfumes were the admiration
of her friends, and the envy of her enemies.</p>

<p>Perhaps the word &#8220;enemy&#8221; is too strong a word to
use. Cæcilia had scarcely enough character to provoke
an enemy. Her colourless nature knew no strong
shadows and no bright lights. She lived for herself
and the passing hour, and the maternal instinct was
dead within her&mdash;dead, so far as any trouble about
her children was concerned. She could love them
till they needed anything at her hands, but if that
point were reached, her love could not show itself in
taking any trouble on their behalf. From all we can
gather in contemporary records, the atmosphere in
which the fashionable Roman lady of these times
lived and moved was a deadening one. A few sprang
out of it, who read and studied their own Latin
authors and the Greek tongue, and with a wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
persistency of purpose mastered many abstruse questions,
and hungered after higher and better things,
and nobler aims.</p>

<p>But Cæcilia, the wife of Severus, was content to be
ignorant; she thought this Christianity, which had cost
her the services of her slave, low and vulgar, too low
and vulgar for her to give it a thought, if she had
one to give. And when she had settled herself on a
couch in the public baths with her three attendants,
she was not well pleased to find Junia, the sister of
Claudius, next her, and intent on asking questions
and getting them answered.</p>

<p>Junia was the daughter of a British chief, or noble,
as the Romans preferred that title, who had married
an Italian girl, previously attached to the person of
one of the ladies brought by a former governor from
Rome.</p>

<p>The stern and rough old Briton had become
enslaved by the beauty and fascination of the young
Cornelia, and had laid himself and all he possessed
at her feet.</p>

<p>She had withered under the cold breath of the
north country, and the rude luxury of the Briton&#8217;s
home had been little in harmony with the early life
Cornelia had spent in Italy. She had died and left
her husband disconsolate, with two children on his
hands, whom he found it hard to manage. They
united the bold daring of the Briton with the quick,
hot passions of the Italian, and before Junia was fifteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
she had thrust a stiletto, in a fit of rage, into the
breast of a slave, and killed her!</p>

<p>To our notions this dreadful act would have
brought upon the girl a lifelong misery, and she
would have been for ever withdrawn from the society
of her friends and relations. But it was widely different
then. The sharp and highly-polished stiletto
was always at hand, and a prick from it, which drew
blood, was frequently administered to a careless or
idle slave.</p>

<p>If the wound had by chance been deeper than was
intended&mdash;well, it was only the loss of a piece of property,
and the master would bear it!</p>

<p>One slave, more or less, was not of very great
moment to a wealthy proprietor. And the slave herself,
unless, as in the case of Ebba, who had suited
the whims of her mistress, was scarcely missed.</p>

<p>Junia was a bold, dark-eyed girl, with the free
and confident manner which was sufficiently dangerous
in a society like that in which she moved. She
was conscious that her British extraction on one side
placed her on a lower level than the proud Roman
ladies of Verulam, but if conscious of it, she never
showed it, and was perfectly unabashed and self confident.</p>

<p>Junia now threw herself down by Cæcilia&#8217;s side,
and tossing back the broad red ribbon which confined
her hair, she exclaimed, &#8220;So the faithful Ebba, the
paragon of perfection, is gone. What will you do
without her services, fair Cæcilia?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>&#8220;I have other maidens at hand,&#8221; said Cæcilia,
coldly. &#8220;They are skilful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, doubtless,&#8221; Junia said, laughing, and showing
a row of white teeth. &#8220;Yes, let her go, I say;
but I know the noble Severus will have her head. I
only hope it will not come in alone, but have company.&#8221;
And again there was a ringing laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;And tell me, beautiful Cæcilia, is it true that
Hyacintha is to be sent to Rome?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Hyacintha is to go to Rome without delay,&#8221;
Cæcilia answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;To be trained for a priestess to the goddess
Vesta?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it may be so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas! What a doleful life for the lovely maiden&mdash;a
priestess&mdash;no marriage for her, no love, no freedom.
I would rather be buried at once in one of the
subterranean places they tell us so much of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My daughter is of tender years,&#8221; said Cæcilia.
&#8220;She will at present only be educated under the care
of her father&#8217;s aunt&mdash;the noble Terentia Rufilla. The
hall of the Vestals is no mean home. They have
everything that is meet for the children of noble
Romans. And,&#8221; continued Cæcilia, with a languid air
of pride, &#8220;be it remembered that Vestals can only be
chosen from the noblest houses of pure, unmixed
descent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Junia laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;no poor maiden whose
father is a son of the conquered race could hope for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the honour. Ah! well, she courts it not. Here comes
my warlike brother. Well, Claudius, how fares it
to-day in the wrestling? Hast thou thrown down
Casca?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Casca!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Casca was not in the
course at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, noble Cæcilia,&#8221; the boy said, &#8220;is it really
true that you part with Casca and Hyacintha? The
arena and the schools are full of rumours to-day.
Some say one thing, some another, but all agree that
Christian superstition has laid an egg in the house
of the noble Severus, and that a brood has been
hatched.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sick of questions,&#8221; exclaimed Cæcilia,
shrinking, as we all do, from the knowledge that our
private affairs are made food for hungry gossips. So
many of us are like the ostrich, and, hiding our heads
in the sand, persuade ourselves that we are unseen
and unnoticed. It was really very troublesome and
fatiguing to be cross-examined by this boy and girl
about private matters, Cæcilia thought! She clapped
her hands, and the maidens in attendance, who had
retired to a quarter of the hall where they and other
slaves and attendants were congregated, signified her
desire that her chariot should be ordered for an
airing on the wide, smooth road known as Watling
Street.</p>

<p>Claudius conducted her to the chariot with an
easy grace which he inherited from his mother.</p>

<p>He had been quick to notice the cloud which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
had called up on the lady&#8217;s face, and Junia&#8217;s laugh
reached his ear, as, turning to some young associates
with whom she was popular, he heard her repeating
the news of the day to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I crave pardon if I have seemed to fail in
respect, lady,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I must ask leave to visit
Casca before sunset.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cæcilia bowed, and smiled graciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall see you at supper-time,&#8221; she said. &#8220;My
husband has bidden the Greek dancing-girls to perform
before us, and one of them plays the lute with
uncommon skill. This will afford amusement for you
and Casca.&#8221;</p>

<p>Claudius thought truly that Casca was in no mood
for dancing-girls and music, but scarcely expected
to find him in the state of melancholy prostration
in his chamber, which at first seemed almost like
despair.</p>

<p>Claudius had a warm heart, and was sincerely
attached to his friend.</p>

<p>He took his accustomed place opposite him, and
rallied him on his sad looks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you heard my fate?&#8221; Casca asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fate! I hear you are to depart to Rome with
Burrhus: a very pleasant fate, by Apollo! I would I
were to accompany you. But, for the sake of all that
is holy, try to wear a brighter face. Half the young
Romans in Verulam will envy you, to say nothing of
a hybrid like me, your humble servant. Nay, now,
Casca, be not a woman,&#8221; Claudius exclaimed, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
some contempt in his tone; &#8220;it is womanish to give in
and moan.&#8221;</p>

<p>Casca had hidden his face in his long, thin hands,
and tears trickled through his fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had a father like mine,&#8221; Casca murmured,
&#8220;you would not wonder at my condition. He came
up hither this morning, raving like a beast in the
arena. He seized me by the robe, and poured forth
a string of epithets I will not repeat. He accused
me of conniving at the poor slave&#8217;s flight, of contaminating
my sister, of being the laughing-stock of
all Verulam, a poltroon, a fool, and I know not what
beside. He swore by all the gods that I should be
placed under Burrhus to fight as a true Roman should
if the Emperor sends out a legion to one of the insubordinate
provinces. And I, oh! Claudius, I loathe
fighting. I hate bloodshed. I crave for peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would I could take your place,&#8221; said Claudius,
&#8220;but my old father would not hear of it if your father
agreed thereto. He looks upon me as the guardian
of Junia, though, forsooth, I am but a poor guardian.
She springs like a tigress if I attempt to check her in
any wild course,&#8221; Claudius sighed. &#8220;Now, you have
a sister who is like a daughter of the gods. You may
well be ready to lay down your life for her. How can
her parents send her hence?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all from the same cause, the dread of the
Christian superstition,&#8221; Casca said. &#8220;They dread her
being infected by poor Ebba&#8217;s teachers. The poor
wretch seldom spoke of her new religion; until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
day of Alban&#8217;s execution she kept silence. I trust we
shall be spared the sickening spectacle of her head
brought back. I can never forget the horror when the
ghastly head of the runaway Syra was brought into
the atrium,&#8221; and Casca shuddered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, Casca, thou wert surely not designed by
the gods for a Roman. Thou shouldst have been born
in one of those far-off islands in the south, where
the effete Greeks lie in flower-wreathed bowers, and,
chewing the leaves of the lotus, pass away life in
alternate slumber and song. Especially, good Casca,
wert thou never designed by the gods to live in our
own rude country and associate with us poor Britons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; Casca said, &#8220;you misjudge me, Claudius.
I would that thou were to accompany me to Rome,
and then I could take heart, but as it is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As it is, you must be like a man, and determine
to win good opinions and make a name; fight for
Rome if so it be ordered, and end at last in continuing
the noble race to which you belong, and
then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Casca, &#8220;and <i>then</i> die, and be remembered
no more. Claudius, I think often of all the
great dead, the old Greeks, their brave soldiers, their
wise philosophers, Socrates and Plato, Aristides and
Themistocles. Their poets and their heroes, all alike
gone&mdash;gone as the man yesterday went on the hill-top&mdash;gone,
and <i>whither</i>? If it be true that there is
another life, what <i>is</i> that life? I torture myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
with questions, and I know that if I were led out to
die as Alban was, I should shiver and tremble, aye,
and pray for mercy. While <i>he</i>&mdash;there was light in his
eye, there was a ring of victory in his voice, and
no wonder that the executioner refused to perform
his office, and died with Alban rather than see him
die by his hand. I say, there must be something
grand and noble in the faith which can give a man
courage not only to meet death, but to welcome it,
to court it, and to see beyond it, instead of darkness,
light.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Claudius, &#8220;but remember, my good
Casca, that thousands of Romans, tens of thousands
of Greeks, aye, and of our own poor Britons also, have
met death as bravely as this man Alban did. There
is a difference in our bodies&mdash;thine and mine, to wit&#8221;&mdash;and
Claudius stretched out his young, muscular arm,
bronzed and bare, from under the loose sleeve of his
toga virilis, which was indeed a contrast to the white,
slender arm of his companion. &#8220;There is a difference,
my good Casca, in the make and build of men, aye,
and of women too, and it is the same with their
natures. Some are brave as lions, others as timid as
sheep. Christian or Roman, Greek or Briton, it is the
same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Casca, starting up, &#8220;but it is <i>not</i> all
the same. Poor Ebba was as timid and shy as any
sheep, and yet she has gone to meet death, for I feel
sure they will track her out. May I be gone hence
ere that time comes! But I say it is something more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
than what we call nature, which is at work with those
who meet death as Alban did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hist! good Casca, be not too free with thy
tongue, or it may bring trouble. Keep thy thoughts
to thyself; even now I fancy I see the curtain moving.
But I must away; I have to practise in the course,
and I have to attend my father to a trial of strength
in the circus, where he is to bestow a prize on the
swiftest runner and strongest arm in throwing the quoit.
Vale! good Casca, and pluck up thy courage.&#8221; Claudius
sprang lightly from the couch, swept the curtain aside,
and disappeared.</p>

<p>In the gallery, which I have before described, at
the top of the villa, he found Hyacintha. She was
looking out over the country, as she had looked with
Ebba two days before. When Claudius stood by her
side she raised her pure, sweet eyes to his, and said,
&#8220;I have been here whilst thou hast been talking to
Casca. I wanted to speak to you, so I waited here.
I am only a child, and I scarcely know which way I
should turn to find the good and forsake the evil, but
this I know, Ebba was good&mdash;faithful and good&mdash;and
I dread lest she should be cruelly killed. Claudius,&#8221;
the child continued, pleading with her eyes as with
her voice, &#8220;Claudius, will you try to save her if by
any means she falls in your way? If the Christians
are found out she will be found with them. Do your
utmost to save her life, my noble, good Ebba.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beautiful Hyacintha,&#8221; Claudius said, &#8220;I would
serve you to my last breath. Yes, I swear if I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
find any trace of Ebba, I will strive to save her life
and put her in a place of safety till the storm has
passed over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They have been talking of getting her head,
and that of Amphibalus, the man Alban hid in his
house, and they have missed another woman, who was
aunt or mother to the soldier who would not kill
Alban. There is a boy who dresses the flowers and
shrubs in the atrium, and he has told me that it is
said in Verulam that the Christians have hidden themselves
not far off, and a watch is set on the hills to
hinder their escape to Wales. That is what is said.
I know not if it be true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True or false, I will obey thy bidding. Say, Hyacintha,
what shall we do without thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Without <i>me</i>!&#8221; the child repeated. &#8220;Ah! I do not
think any one wants me here. My mother will have
the little Livia from the nurse. She is the child of
my uncle Fabius, and the adopted daughter of my
father. She is very beautiful, and my mother can pet
her, and toy with her, and will love to hear the praises
which her loveliness will win. And when my father&#8217;s
service is over in Britain they will all return to Rome,
and I shall greet them there, when I am a priestess,
and I shall greet thee also, Claudius.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; said the boy, &#8220;thou wilt forget the poor
half-Briton, half-Roman, when thou art a grand priestess,
wearing the white stole.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forget! nay, I shall never forget&mdash;how can I
forget? And when I have to tend the fire in the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
temple at night, and the stars look down at me, and
the wind whispers low, I shall pray that the goddess
may bless thee, Claudius, and keep ever in thy heart
a pure bright flame of love to the city of Verulam
first, and of Rome after, and that thou wilt remember
little Hyacintha.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will remember thee through life till death,&#8221; the
young man said. &#8220;I will worship thee from afar, and,
perchance, I may come to Rome only to behold thee,
as I behold a star in the heavens, who blesses me with
its beams, though I can never attain to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took one of the child&#8217;s hands in his, bent his
face over it for a moment, and when Hyacintha withdrew
it, it was wetted by the tear which had fallen
from Claudius&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small>CAPTURE AND DEATH.</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> warm summer weather was in favour of the
little band of Christians who had concealed themselves
in the cave at Radburn. But the long days and
short nights made their marches towards Wales very
slow, as all had to be done under cover of darkness,
and not until they had moved away some miles from
Verulam did Amphibalus dare to allow them to march
by daylight. The little company always separated into
detachments, and Agatha kept Ebba, the Christian
Anna, under her especial care. Agatha was the right
person to inspire poor Anna with confidence. She
was bright and active, and had a cheerfulness and
even merriment at command which often surprised the
timid and retiring Anna.</p>

<p>The warm, dry weather made it easy to sleep out
of doors, and Agatha and Anna, with an old man and
his daughter, had arrived one morning at a clearing
in a thick wood, where a stone altar showed that it
was a resort of the Druids.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must not tarry here,&#8221; Agatha said, &#8220;the danger
from the Druids would be as great as the danger from
the Romans. We must push on westward, and I believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
there is a deep forest where we can easily hide.
Amphibalus mentioned it as a secure resting-place for
a few days, and we are sure to meet him before the
day is spent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is so pleasant here,&#8221; Anna said; &#8220;let us at any
rate take some food, and perform our morning worship.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Agatha said they must move on, as it was
dangerous to tarry near what was evidently a resort of
the Druids. She had scarcely done speaking, when
some tall figures were seen approaching: an old man,
with a white beard and still whiter robe, and most
venerable aspect, and a few young men and boys.</p>

<p>There was nothing alarming in their appearance,
and Agatha, rising, made a deep reverence. The old
man bore in his hand a golden crescent-shaped knife,
and he wore on his white robe a heavy chain of
rudely-moulded emblems.</p>

<p>&#8220;Art thou come to worship, my daughter?&#8221; said
the old priest. &#8220;The sun has risen, and the hour is
at hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; said Agatha boldly, &#8220;I am a fugitive from
the Roman city of Verulam, and only crave permission
to pass onwards, with my companions.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young men now drew nearer, and scanned the
little party with curious, eager eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Romans are our masters and tyrants; no
marvel you would escape them.&#8221; Then, turning to
Anna, &#8220;You, poor child, look pale and wan, and you,
old man, aweary. If it be possible for you, I bid you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
halt awhile, while I proceed with our short worship;
afterwards we will share a repast with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Agatha shook her head. &#8220;You are very gracious,
my lord, but we are anxious to get on our
way;&#8221; and she added, &#8220;We are Christians, and worship
only the true God.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a murmur amongst the young men, and
Anna trembled. She knew full well that human sacrifices
were a part of her old religion, for the Briton&#8217;s
religion was then chiefly represented by the Druidical
faith.</p>

<p>But Anna need not have been afraid. The old
priest waved his hand, and then, disappearing in a
thicket with his followers, chanting a low dirge-like
monotone, he returned with a large cluster of the
mistletoe, the sacred plant which was cut and offered
on the altar at intervals at the morning worship. Then
followed a strange invocation muttered in a low, guttural
voice, the Druid priest raising his hands to the
summer sky.</p>

<p>The sun was just high enough to strike athwart
the grassy glade, and illuminated the boles of the
trees with a golden radiance. The priest&#8217;s white robe
shone in the new-born light, and every leaf was turned
to an emerald, every dew-drop to a diamond.</p>

<p>The birds sang, and there was the rustle of awakening
activity in the forest. A squirrel hopped from the
overhanging boughs of a tall larch, and the wood
pigeons told their sweet monotonous story of love.</p>

<p>All things seemed to swell the chorus of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
earth&#8217;s thanksgiving hymn for light and blessing
bestowed.</p>

<p>And who shall say what dim visions of a beautiful
and unknown God filled the heart of the aged priest,
as he offered his orison according to the form hallowed
to him by the usage of ages!</p>

<p>When all was over he waved his hand, and his
little congregation dispersed, the priest returning presently
with a quantity of dried fruits and cakes which
had been baked over an open fire.</p>

<p>There was also a rudely-shaped stone jar, from
which was poured a drink distilled from certain herbs,
and pleasant to the taste.</p>

<p>That beverage, the priest said, had wonderful properties,
and he continually dispensed it as a medicine
when strength was exhausted.</p>

<p>Agatha ate a hearty meal, and so did the old man
and his daughter, but Anna could not eat. She was
weighed down with a sense of danger and distress,
and her heart turned continually to those whom she
had left behind at Verulam. At Agatha&#8217;s order, however,
she drank a little from the jar, and ate a few
crumbs broken off the thick mass of dried cake, which
had a bitter rather than a sweet flavour, as it was
mixed with the flour ground out of acorns.</p>

<p>Presently the old priest said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye are Christians, you say. There has been an
arm of fury stretched out against you, so we have
heard. For ourselves, we have no bitterness against
you. The Romans are our conquerors as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
yours, but they leave us to our old faith undisturbed
for the most part. How have you incurred their dire
displeasure? I tell you, you cannot resist the Romans&#8217;
power; they are the masters of the world. They will
treat you like beasts of burden if you resist not, but
they will kill you if you are rebellious. From whom
do you flee?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We flee from the persecution, which has taken
the life of a holy man named Alban. We are under
the guidance of one Amphibalus, who is to gather us
safely in a certain valley amongst the mountains of
Wales, where we may worship our Lord, and form a
struggling church.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will fail to do it; the bloodhounds will track
you out. Renounce your false religion, and go back
to your homes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221; said Agatha, &#8220;we will never bow the
knee in the heathen temple, or worship at the sacrifices
of the false gods.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old Druid priest shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;My daughter, you are fighting against a legion;
you will never prevail. I know,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;that
the old faiths are shaking. I know many of our people
have been massacred. We have peace now, but I see&mdash;I
see in the distance, when I am dead&mdash;I see the
legions of the North Sea conquering, trampling down
our faith as yours, and wading through the blood of
Druid and Christian alike. We are peaceful, and there
are many of the sick and the stricken in body, even
lepers, who come to us, and not in vain, for cure. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
have salves for wounds, and physic for pain; we are
skilled in the compounding of the herbs which are
given for the good of mankind. But we are a body
of men diminishing year by year, and our time is
short.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! father,&#8221; said Agatha, touched by the pathos
of the old man&#8217;s words, &#8220;oh, father, have you never
heard of Jesus the Lord, who died a cruel death to
save us all? I would that I could show you the way
to Him. The father, Amphibalus, could show it. But
I tell you that He opens His arms wide to receive
you, and all the Britons, and every dweller on the
face of the earth. Oh! could you but come to Him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye,&#8221; said the old Christian, &#8220;would that you
could come!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come whither?&#8221; asked the Druid proudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the Cross of Christ,&#8221; said Anna firmly. This
was the first time that she had spoken, and her words
sounded with peculiar power.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the Cross of Christ,&#8221; she repeated, &#8220;and if we
bear it after Him, we shall wear a crown.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old priest extended his hand towards Anna
as if in blessing, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;And where is that crown, my daughter? It is
not to be found in the depths of the forest, where the
wolves roar at night, and the dangers of robbers and
thieves are all around.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Anna said, &#8220;the crown may be even there.
As for me, I am a poor faint-hearted girl, and I can
speak with no true courage, as Agatha can, but like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
whisper in my soul from heaven I hear the words,
&#8216;The crown is laid up in the heavens for you, who
are kept by God&#8217;s power through faith.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our Lord,&#8221; Agatha continued, as Anna stopped,
&#8220;our Lord wore a crown of thorns, that we might wear
a crown of jewels. We know in Whom we believe.
If those who are seeking us were to break through
the thicket yonder, and shed our blood on your altar,
yet through death, as Jesus passed, I know that we
should pass to our joyful resurrection. And, oh!&#8221; exclaimed
Agatha, &#8220;think you we would give up the
precious possession of the love of Christ? Have I not
seen its power? Do I not know that it is as the sunshine
piercing the deep of the forest at dawn, and
bringing life and light to the soul? We may not
tarry,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;for we have to press forward
on our journey, but we will pray for you, father, and
may our God reward you for your charity towards us,
the poor hunted Christians, who nevertheless rejoice
in their name.&#8221;</p>

<p>The four then moved away, and the thick summer
foliage soon hid them from the Druidical priest.</p>

<p>He stood gazing after them like one in a trance,
and the young men gathered round him, expecting to
hear from his lips some strange, prophetic utterances,
or some recital of the past glory of their race. But
no words came, and after a few minutes of profound
silence the young men departed, one by one leaving
their chief still wrapt in his devotions and meditations.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>The way through the forest was long and toilsome,
and poor Anna often lay trembling by Agatha&#8217;s
side, listening all night to the howling of the wolves.
Amphibalus joined them from time to time, and at
last, when the first golden leaf was telling the story
of coming autumn in the woods, the whole band was
settled in a remote village on the borders of Wales,
girt in with mountains, and entirely hidden as they
thought, from the eyes of their persecutors.</p>

<p>There were continued additions to their numbers,
and we are told that there were a thousand converts
baptised by Amphibalus&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p>Amphibalus himself was often absent for days together,
and boldly preached Christ to the poor native
idolaters of the district. Some drank in the good
tidings eagerly, like drops of living water, and the
little colony throve for a time.</p>

<p>The mountain streams provided them with fish,
and the woods with wild rabbits and hares, for meat.
They constructed huts with twigs and reeds curiously
plaited together, and covered with a sticky clay which,
when mixed with water, kept out the rain and the
wind.</p>

<p>The life was a hard one, but it was peaceful, and
none of those who had given up all for Christ turned
regretful looks backward.</p>

<p>The leading spirit amongst the women was Agatha,
who was always cheerful and full of hope.</p>

<p>Anna&#8217;s skill with her hands was much appreciated,
and the women of the little band were taught by her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
to plait their hair, and mend their torn garments, with
the delicate spikes of the fir-trees for needles, and
slender strands of dried, long grass for thread.</p>

<p>Amphibalus returned from one of his missionary
expeditions early one morning. By common consent
Agatha was considered the adviser-in-chief of the
community, and Amphibalus came at once to the hut
where she and Anna were busily engaged in tying up
the long leaves of the bulrush and iris, which were to
be twisted into wicks for the rude lamps that were to
lighten the long winter nights. The oil was made
from the fat of the animals which were snared for
food, and carefully preserved by Agatha&#8217;s orders.</p>

<p>Amphibalus&#8217;s face was grave and anxious when he
appeared at the door or opening of the hut, and he
beckoned Agatha to come outside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is aught wrong?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the heathen idolaters of the old
British gods have discovered our hiding-place, and
they will be upon us with more fierceness than the
Romans. I dread them, daughter, more than I dread
the Roman torture. Not for myself,&#8221; he added, &#8220;but
for the weak women and maidens, and the young
boys in our community. I have seen a horde of these
wild people, with fierce and threatening aspect, yesterday,
and overheard their jargon, which, as far as I
made it out, told of enmity and bad intentions. An
effort must be made to escape from their clutches,
and we must separate, the women under protection of
the bravest men amongst us, and take different ways<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
through the forest. This village must be broken up,
and we must leave as little trace behind us as we can.
But I would fain gather the people together for a last
word of prayer and praise, and break the bread and
drink the cup once more ere we part.&#8221;</p>

<p>By mid-day, nearly all his people had assembled,
and Amphibalus then addressed them. He told them
he had reason to believe they were discovered by
their enemies, and that the church must be scattered.
But he added&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let it be scattered as seed. Let every one of
you hold fast the faith, and wherever you wander, tell
the people of the God whom you serve, and be not
afraid to confess Christ. As for myself, I feel that the
time of my departure is at hand, and I will gladly
follow the dear and honoured Alban, who laid down
his life for me. Weep not for me, for I may say, &#8216;I
am ready to be offered, and I fear not.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, amidst tears and sighing, the service was
proceeded with, and scarcely had the blessing left the
priest&#8217;s lips when the whole congregation separated in
detachments under his orders, having first pulled
down the huts they had so lately erected; and taking
different routes, they spread themselves once more in
the forest.</p>

<p>Amphibalus led the little band, in which were
Agatha and Anna, with some sixteen more, stout of
heart and strong of limb, able to offer resistance.
There were women and children amongst them, who
were placed in the centre of the square, four men at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the rear, and four in the van, and four on either side.
In this order they marched along for three days,
Amphibalus&#8217;s aim being to get into another district
nearer Verulam, where he knew a church had been
founded.</p>

<p>It was on the evening of the third day&#8217;s march
that one of the outposts came running in breathless
to the place, under an overhanging rock, where some
thirty of the wanderers had encamped for the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Romans are upon us!&#8221; he exclaimed; &#8220;I
have heard the clanging of armour, and climbing a
tree, I saw nearly fifty soldiers, and heard them say
they had got on the track of the fugitives.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scarcely had the man delivered himself of his
message, falling down exhausted with the exertion he
had made to reach Amphibalus, when the trampling
of horses&#8217; hoofs was heard, and the Roman officer who
was in command of the fifty men called to them to
halt, &#8220;for the game was scented out at last.&#8221; By the
side of the Roman commander was a young man
scarcely past boyhood, who had prayed to be allowed
to accompany the expedition, that he might, as he
said, see some service for his master, and track out
the Christians to their destruction. This young man
was Claudius, the son of the Briton who held a high
position in Verulam.</p>

<p>At a word from the commander of the force, a
rough, stern man, named Valens, the Christians were
seized and bound with manacles, and told they were
to follow on foot to Radburn. But the strong men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
made a desperate resistance, and a fearful struggle
ensued. Amphibalus in vain exhorted them to cease
to fight, for that he was ready to accompany Valens,
and no coercion would be needful for him. But no
one listened to his voice, and Anna, clinging to Agatha,
hid her face, that she might not see the terrible conflict
which dyed the green sward with blood, and
made the wood resound with cries and groans. Some
of the women of the company cried out that they
would recant, and Agatha in vain exhorted them to
be firm to their faith. Terror-stricken and distressed
for their husbands and brothers, they threw themselves
before Valens and entreated for mercy.</p>

<p>Alas! none was shown, and Amphibalus was bound
tightly, and constrained to stand by and see his followers
fall one by one dead upon the turf, where
several of the Romans&#8217; bodies lay, covered with blood,
which flowed from ghastly wounds.</p>

<p>At last, when the slaughter was ended by the entire
mastery of the Roman band, the word was given
to march, and by the light of a pale moon the remnant
of Amphibalus&#8217;s followers, fainting and exhausted,
were obliged to follow their captors towards Radburn.</p>

<p>Before they reached Radburn the next day news
was brought in that the idolaters of South Wales had
fallen upon and slaughtered the rest of Amphibalus&#8217;s
church; and there was a thrill of triumph through the
Roman band that the martyrdom of Alban had not
increased the numbers of the Christians in these parts,
for nearly all those who had been won over by Amphibalus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
were killed. Only a few remained. Agatha and
Anna, and some half-dozen more women and children,
with two old men, whose aged feet could scarcely
bear them along the rugged paths of the forest.</p>

<p>Radburn was reached the next day, and here the
Christians were consigned to dismal dungeons to await
the Governor&#8217;s orders.</p>

<p>Agatha and Anna were shut into a damp cell,
where a little water and some dry bread were all the
food allotted to them, and Amphibalus was separated
from the rest of the poor converts, and, heavily fettered,
was literally thrown into a dungeon under the rude
stone dwelling which served for a prison, and where
neither light nor air could penetrate.</p>

<p>He was brought out the next day, and a hasty
tribunal was formed. He stood before his accusers
with a calm and unmoved countenance. He was
asked if he would save his life, and he answered&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would save it were it my Lord&#8217;s will, but if
He calls me to the crown of martyrdom, as He called
my friend, who laid down his life for me, I will
humbly receive it.&#8221; He was roughly struck upon the
mouth, and then asked if he would at once resort to
the temple at Verulam, and, prostrating himself there,
renounce his evil practices.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I know of no evil practices to
renounce, but I will never deny my Lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you nought else to say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, save that I would pray you to shield two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
weak women of my company from the sight of my
sufferings.&#8221;</p>

<p>This request, as might be expected, had the
opposite effect to what Amphibalus desired. Agatha
and Anna were dragged out to the open space, where
a crowd scarcely less numerous than that which had
assembled to witness the death of Alban were pressing
round to see Amphibalus suffer.</p>

<p>It may truly be said that they stoned Amphibalus
calling upon God, and commending his spirit to Him
for Whose sake he lay down his life. Death by
stoning seemed to make a more profound impression
on the spectators than death by the sword, and the
savage executioners who were hired to fling the stones
upon the martyr showed no pity. Rather, they delighted
to prolong his sufferings, and they were
intense.</p>

<p>Scarcely less intense were those of the two women
who were compelled to see the cruel deed accomplished.
A deep swoon mercifully spared Anna the
prolonged torture which Agatha had to undergo, nor
could she at the first raise her voice, as her friend
did, to cheer and encourage the martyr.</p>

<p>There was one present who watched Anna with
something more than common interest. Claudius remembered
the words of little Hyacintha, and his promise
to save her, if it were possible. Now, the boy
knew well enough that to help a Christian to escape
was scarcely a less heinous offence than to profess the
faith himself. But Hyacintha&#8217;s pleading eyes, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
gentle voice, her beautiful little hands raised in appeal,
rose before him, and he was thinking over every
possible way whereby he could save Anna. The two
women were remanded to their cell to await the
Governor&#8217;s pleasure, and Claudius obtained permission
of Valens after he had conducted them thither to remain
as their guard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou art early in thy zeal for the gods, brave
Claudius, but thy strong arm yesterday did such good
service that I am willing to leave thee in command
here of a handful of soldiers large enough for the
occasion. One of the women looks dead already, and
will save us further trouble. As to the rest, I think
the Governor may desire to apply torture before finally
disposing of them. By the gods, Claudius, what fools
these Christians are!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fools, indeed,&#8221; said Claudius. &#8220;I do not care
what short work I make with the men. I slew three
yesterday, after a fierce tussle, but women&mdash;weak
women&mdash;well, I&#8217;d as lief not crush them out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are these two women?&#8221; Valens asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;One belongs to the family of the soldier who
refused to strike off Alban&#8217;s head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! then she is a dangerous reptile. The other
looks harmless, poor wretch; and what hair&mdash;like the
autumn leaves with the sun on it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Claudius replied, hastily, &#8220;yes, she is a
Briton, methinks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has aught been heard of the runaway slave of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the noble Severus? He offered a high price for her
head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, not that I know of. He has forgotten it ere
now; the fair Cæcilia has supplied her place by a
Greek, so Junia, my sister, affirms.&#8221;</p>

<p>Valens shrugged his broad shoulders. &#8220;The fair
Cæcilia has freed herself of all burdens now. That
little daughter of hers, and the weakling Casca, are
sent off to Rome under Burrhus&#8217;s convoy; the maiden
is to be buried for life in the Temple of Vesta. Why,
her beauty, at this tender age, is enough to turn the
heads of a legion. Perhaps it has turned thine, good
Claudius!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have something else to think of than fair faces,&#8221;
said Claudius. &#8220;Has news arrived of Burrhus&#8217;s reaching
Rome?&#8221; he asked, carelessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, I am not so like to hear as thou art. Thy
sister, Junia, is continually a guest in the house of
Severus. He is a high and mighty man, forsooth;
they call him second to the Governor. Methinks he
has more power than the Governor: and I must not
delay any longer, but seek both noble personages and
find out their will, and I think I may claim a reward
for the last day&#8217;s work. We tracked out the wretches
cleverly enough, and came upon that band of thirty
with a swoop. Catching the chief, Amphibalus, was
somewhat a greater catch than if we had only surprised
the others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We were saved that trouble by the Welsh folk,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Claudius said. &#8220;A man came in this morning to say
not one of the eight hundred is left.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, but that is good hearing. I can now claim
my reward with some assurance. Crushing out the
whole swarm of Christians was more than was expected.
I&#8217;ll put in your claim, young Claudius; which
shall it be, a gold chain or a slave, eh!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I desire neither,&#8221; said Claudius, haughtily. &#8220;Methinks
we Britons want no slaves, and as to gold collars,
let my sister have the chain, if one be accorded.
Commission for foreign service is the only reward I
claim.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll leave you to press the claim yourself,&#8221; Valens
said, in an offended voice. Then in a loud stentorian
tone he told off half-a-dozen of his men, and ordered
them to remain under the authority of the young
Claudius until he returned on the following day, and
brought back orders as to the fate of the prisoners
who were confined in the dungeon.</p>

<p>And then Valens, followed by his troop, rode off
towards Verulam.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>CLAUDIUS FULFILS HIS VOW.</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Claudius</span> was no more inclined to the Christian
faith than he had been when we last saw him in the
room of Casca, the son of Severus. But he felt himself
pledged to perform his vow, sworn by the gods,
that if ever it were in his power he would save Ebba,
the British slave, so well beloved by Hyacintha, the
daughter of the noble Severus.</p>

<p>Since she and her brother had left Verulam, in
the sunny days of July, for that distant Rome, which
was then, to all intents and purposes, as far from
Verulam as San Francisco or Lima would be from
the St. Albans of to-day, Claudius had felt a terrible
blank in his life. Games and athletic sports, feats of
arms, and dashing military exercises, were much to
him, but till he had lost Casca he did not know how
his life had been bound up in him. Those pleasant
talks in the twilight with Casca, who had read much,
and was of a studious rather than a warlike nature,
were all over. Claudius had felt the fascination of
Casca&#8217;s conversation, although he professed to despise
all those aspirations and longings which were in the
boy&#8217;s heart, and welled up like an irrepressible spring,
which could not be stopped in its overflow. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Casca and his young sister&#8217;s departure all the gentler
elements had died out of Claudius&#8217;s life, and he had
thrown himself more eagerly into any amusements, or
any occupation which could drown reflection, living
only in the present, and persuading himself that the
present was enough. His old father had filled a post
of honour under Carausius, who had held Britain as
an independent province for ten years. Then Carausius
was assassinated by Allectus, who had at first asserted
himself, and held the command with but few Roman
soldiers, and a large army of the northern tribes, who
are now known to be the Caledonians.</p>

<p>When at last the whole province was united under
the Imperial sway of Diocletian, old Caradon lived on
in gloomy subjection to Roman authority, asking no
public office, and allowing his two children, left to
him by his Italian wife, to follow their own devices.
He found them harder to control than any of the
savage tribes over whom, during the temporary rule
of Carausius, he had held authority; and the evening
of his days was spent in a state of inaction and regret
for the times which were past.</p>

<p>Severus treated him with a hardly concealed contempt,
and his temper was soured and his patience
tried by the wild freaks of his daughter Junia, and
the independent spirit of his son Claudius, who had
eagerly caught at the offer of accompanying Valens to
hunt out the Christians under Amphibalus: little thinking
that he should find Ebba amongst them, and be
compelled to fulfil the solemn vow he had made to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Hyacintha, the daughter of Severus, and the sister of
his friend Casca.</p>

<p>Now, as he paced up and down before the rude
stone building which was used as a sort of courthouse
and prison in Radburn, Claudius thought on all possible
means to effect her escape. As soon as it became
known that Ebba was one of the two women who had
been brought to Radburn with Amphibalus, she would
be seized and beheaded, so that the price set upon
her head in the spring might be claimed.</p>

<p>Claudius well knew the risk he ran in aiding and
abetting Ebba&#8217;s escape, but he was brave and honourable,
and held his vow made to Hyacintha by the
gods as binding.</p>

<p>There was no time to lose. Valens would at once
see the Governor and Severus at Verulam, and it was
only too probable that the two women, Agatha and
Anna, would be taken before them the next morning.
They would be called upon to renounce their faith,
the British slave Ebba would be recognised, and for
her there could be no hope of mercy; while Agatha&#8217;s
connection with the soldier who had died rather than
carry out the sentence of death on Alban, would
probably cause her to be tortured, if not instantly
beheaded.</p>

<p>Under cover of the darkness of the late October
night, before the moon, now on the wane, rose in the
eastern sky, Claudius felt whatever he did must be
done at once.</p>

<p>He summoned the men under his command to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
small square hall in the building. A fire had been
kindled there, and the smoke made its way out by
the slits and apertures which pierced at intervals the
thick walls. Claudius was a young commander, and
the stout Roman soldiers were at first rather inclined
to resent his authority. Claudius, however, had that
free, pleasant manner which the roughest and hardest
natures find it impossible to resist.</p>

<p>He ordered two of the men to go out and cater
for provisions, adding, &#8220;We will sup together to-night,
and will not spare the cup. See that every one of
you gets his fill.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he seated himself at the board on the rude
bench which was placed near it, and the village of
Radburn was soon found sufficient to supply the
wants of the little band, and satisfy even their large
appetites.</p>

<p>They ate and drank, and grew first hilarious and
then heavy. The man in charge of the dungeon was
invited to join the party, and several people from the
village were also bidden to come in as they stood
round the open door, and the soldiers&#8217; carousal ended
by their stretching themselves on the floor, and
sleeping heavily, from the effects of over-eating, over-drinking,
and fatigue; for the forced marches through
the forest, and the fierce contest with the Christians,
had tried even their herculean strength to the uttermost.</p>

<p>So far, Claudius&#8217;s scheme had answered; he feigned
to sleep heavily, and when all was quiet, about nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
o&#8217;clock, he crept softly past the sleepers, and went out
into the darkness.</p>

<p>As he went down the steep incline from the courthouse,
he stumbled against some dark object, and a
piteous voice exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the love of Heaven, have pity on me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; Claudius asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;A poor wandering Jew, whose only daughter has
fallen down, worn out with illness and fatigue, and
has passed hence, in the darkness, to Abraham&#8217;s
bosom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You dog!&#8221; Claudius exclaimed, &#8220;how came you
hither?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I came over to Britain seeking for pearls, with
which your rivers abound, but I have found none, but
lost my own pearl. She is dead! she is dead!&#8221; he
moaned. &#8220;I have carried her thus far, and none in
this heathen village would give me shelter. I know by
the heavy weight with which she lies in my arms that
she is dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Claudius strode back to the hall, and taking a
burning ember from the mass upon the hearth, and
returning, threw the light of a torch he had kindled
upon the girl&#8217;s face. Yes, she was dead&mdash;must have
been dead for hours.</p>

<p>Her father, gazing on her, burst into a low wail,
and rocking himself to and fro, cried for pity and
mercy from Jehovah.</p>

<p>A sudden thought flashed upon Claudius.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hearken, old man, wretched dog as you are, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
you will do me a service I will pay you in gold pieces,
but it must be done at once. Leave your daughter&#8217;s
body to me for burial, and betake yourself to a
thicket just beyond the village. Stay there till I come
to you, and I will ensure you safe departure. If
you refuse, by the gods, I will drag you before the
Governor to-morrow, and see you torn limb from limb.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! good sir! Oh! kind sir! have pity. My
daughter! my daughter!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is dead,&#8221; Claudius replied, as throwing the
light of the torch on the pale, still face, wan and attenuated
by sickness, and set in its frame of raven
hair it looked white as snow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor creature!&#8221; Claudius said, &#8220;she is young to
die, but we all die, some old, some young; it is the
fate of all, and the gods take the best first. Now,
Jew, there must be no delay. Shall I carry away your
daughter, and in return will you, for gold, which I
will bring you, do my behest? It must be now, or it
will be too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke, Claudius took the old man roughly
by the arm, and setting him on his feet, raised the
body of the dead maiden in his arms, and bidding the
Jew follow him, went down to the road below.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The long, dark hours had passed slowly in the
dungeon, where, after the cruel scene of the morning,
Agatha and Anna had sat together, waiting for death.
Anna had revived when she had swallowed a few
drops of cold water, and Agatha, though utterly exhausted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
herself, seating herself by the wall, had
gathered the girl tenderly into her maternal arms, and
revived her, as best she could, by chafing her cold
hands, and pressing her close to her bosom.</p>

<p>Then, while Agatha watched, Anna had slept at
intervals, and the elder woman did her best to encourage
and comfort the younger.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has been a fearsome day and fiery trial for
thee, Anna,&#8221; Agatha said. &#8220;How wilt thou bear the
morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said poor Anna, in a low but firm voice,
&#8220;I think I can bear my own pain better than witnessing
that of another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou hast no lurking fear, then, that when the
trial comes thou wilt deny thy Lord?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; Anna said, &#8220;I, who have been so weak-hearted,
feel that He gives me strength; and, Agatha,
I have had a wondrous and beautiful dream. I dreamed
I saw the golden city, and the great gates, through
which only the pure of heart can pass. There was a
soft light all round, like the light in the atrium when
all the silver lamps were kindled, and there was the
murmur of many waters. Then, as I stood at the
gates, afraid to enter, I heard a voice say, &#8216;Come up
hither.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I answered, &#8216;I dare not; I am only a slave, a
poor slave;&#8217; and the voice said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I have bought thee with a price, and thou art
Mine.&#8217; And then, Agatha, I saw my own beautiful little
mistress, Hyacintha. I wondered to see her there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
standing at the gate. I thought it must be the temple
of Vesta, and not the Holy City. My mistress was
still a child, yet not a child. She wore a long white
robe, and her figure was tall and stately. Her hair
was bound with a gold fillet, which made a shining
circle around her head. She held out her arms to
me, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Anna! Anna!&#8217; Then I wondered why she called
me Anna, for I had ever been Ebba to her&mdash;Ebba,
the British slave-girl. Then she said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I have come to meet thee at the gate. I have
come to bid thee welcome; the Lord has sent me for
thee.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I marvelled much how that could be, for I knew
my little mistress was to be a priestess of the goddess
Vesta, and that she must worship her, and not the
Lord Jesus.</p>

<p>&#8220;But then the voice of one I could not see, seemed
to answer my thoughts, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I have bought you both with a price, you are
Mine; enter ye into the Heavenly City, and go out no
more.&#8217; Then my little mistress, fair Hyacintha, took
my hand, and we went up the golden street together,
and there was again the sound of many waters, and
of sweet music, and countless glad voices; and then I
opened my eyes, and all was dark&mdash;so dark&mdash;but I
felt thy arm pressing me to thy heart, Agatha, and was
comforted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My poor child,&#8221; Agatha sighed, &#8220;I would that
thy dream were true. There is sharp pain first before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
thou canst enter through the gates. Say, wilt thou
be able to endure to the end, as our master, Amphibalus,
and holy Alban did?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am but weak; I am but weak and young,&#8221; Anna
said, &#8220;but He is with me. I hope we shall go together,
Agatha.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would fain hope so; but it may not be; perchance
that would be too great a favour at the hands
of our persecutors. While thou hast been dreaming,
a dream, I doubt not, sent to thee from heaven, by
the love of our Lord, I have been thinking over my
life. Here, in this dark dungeon, I saw before me a
peaceful hut, on the borders of the great river, where
as a girl I played, and often went with my father in
the coracle, to gather the oysters from their bed as
the water ebbed, and to pick out the pearls from them
when the shells were forced open. I mind me that
my father would say that the oysters the hardest to
force open always held the finest pearls. Since I
have become a Christian, I have thought often of those
words. For verily the Pearl of Great Price is not easy
to obtain, and we find it with much pain and searching.
I became afterwards the wife of a brave man, and
the mother of two noble boys. I saw them all killed,
in a fight between our people and some who owed
allegiance to Carausius. I thought my heart was broken
then, and I wanted in my blindness to end my life
by plunging a dagger into my breast. But it was
then that I came with Heraclius, my kinsman, under
the teaching of Amphibalus, and the Lord showed me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
that to live according to His will was a nobler thing
than to give up the life He had bestowed, ere it was
His good pleasure to recall it. Thus I lived, and I
have nursed the sick at Verulam, and, in my humble
way, held the cross of Christ before the eyes of those,
who, clasping it to their hearts, have found it turned
into a crown. It was at the secret meetings of the
Christians that I first saw thee, the frightened, trembling
Ebba, the slave of the rich and noble Severus.
Then how my love flowed forth to thee on the hill-side,
on that early summer night when Amphibalus
baptised thee, and thy name was no longer Ebba but
Anna. And we have shared perils and trials together
since then, dear one, and love has knit our hearts in
a bond that death cannot break.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! that we may die together,&#8221; Anna said. &#8220;I
thought this morning, when the darkness came over
me like a cold wave, it was death. Will dying be
like that swoon, thinkest thou?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, for thou wilt open thy eyes in a glorious
light instead of in this black, chill cell,&#8221; Agatha replied.</p>

<p>Thus the two poor prisoners talked to one another,
and comforted one another with the words of Him
who had gone the rugged way before them; and the
shadow of the dark valley&mdash;for they looked for death
on the morrow&mdash;was brightened for them by the
presence of their Lord.</p>

<p>Presently Anna said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are pulling back the bolts! they are unlocking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the gate! Are they at hand who will kill us, here
in the darkness?&#8221;</p>

<p>Agatha sat upright and listened; yes, there was
the slow, grating noise made by the pulling back of
heavy bolts, and the rusty key turned in the rude hole
which formed a lock.</p>

<p>Then the heavy gate opened, a draught of chill
air came in, and some one was evidently entering
slowly, as one who bore a burden.</p>

<p>No one spoke, the door was closed, and then a
lamp or lanthorn, formed with a wick floating in oil,
was uncovered, and showed a tall young man, standing
by the prostrate figure which he had evidently just
deposited at his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another prisoner!&#8221; Agatha exclaimed. &#8220;Sir,
what brings you here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Anna, shading her dazed eyes with her hands,
exclaimed, &#8220;It is the noble Claudius, the friend of
my young mistress Hyacintha!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is I. I was with Valens in the expedition;
you saw me then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We saw you, young Claudius,&#8221; Agatha said, &#8220;and
may God forgive your part in the slaughter of that
cruel day. Are you come to end our sufferings with
your sword? If it be so, hasten your work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; Claudius said; &#8220;nay, I have sworn a solemn
oath to save Ebba, the British slave, if it lay in my
power. There is only one way by which I can do it;
this dead girl shall be left here, and Ebba shall come
forth with me, to take her place with her father, whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
I have, under cover of the darkness, hidden in the
thick brushwood just beyond the village. Thither I
will guide Ebba, leaving the dead girl with you, and
taking the living one to a place of safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anna clasped her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot, I cannot come,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I will
remain here to die.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, that must not be,&#8221; said Claudius. &#8220;I swore
to the pure fair maiden who was your mistress, and
who loved you so well, to save your life. I must
perform my vow. See here, you elder woman, I shall
return to-morrow to lead you out at the Governor&#8217;s
command. I call upon you to make no sign whereby
you betray that this poor child lying at your feet is
other than the Christian who was present with you
yesterday. If you do make that sign, you will cost
me my life. If not, I will order the soldiers to kindle
a funeral pile, and all that will be left of this poor
child, whom her father calls Rachel, will be burned to
ashes before the sun sets to-morrow. Now,&#8221; said
Claudius, &#8220;I have not a moment to lose,&#8221; and stooping,
he raised Anna in his strong arms, and was
striding away with her, when Agatha said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold! Good Claudius, I will utter no lie about
this dead child. I am forbidden by my Lord to lie. I
may be mute, but I will not speak, if by speaking I
am to tell that this corpse is that of Ebba the Saxon
slave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I pray you, I beseech you, good sir!&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Anna exclaimed, &#8220;leave me here. I cannot, cannot,
leave Agatha alone with the dead!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My vow is upon me,&#8221; Claudius said, &#8220;and you
must come, whether you will or no.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But whither? whither? to die in a forest? to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush! I pray you, dear Anna,&#8221; Agatha said.
&#8220;This is the hand of God. He may desire thy young
and vigorous life for service for Him. The means are
in His hands. But I pray you, noble Claudius, assure
me that this poor lamb, who lieth here so still and cold,
met her death by no evil practice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, I know nothing, save that when disturbed
in mind as to how I could perform my vow, and
escape the anger of the gods, I stumbled on an old
whining dog, of the people they call the Jews, crying
over his dead child. Here seemed the way for Ebba&#8217;s
escape, and I took it, and I can sacrifice to the gods
to-morrow with a good heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go then, dear child, my child in the Son of God
and faith in Christ, and may the Lord be with thee;
one more kiss, and then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>There was not time for another word; Claudius
threw the light burden over his shoulder, and departed
cautiously, as he had come, drawing the bolts and
turning the key, and leaving Agatha, the Christian
woman, alone in darkness with the dead.</p>

<p>Claudius strode along through brambles and thicket,
till he reached the very cave where the Christians had
taken refuge after Alban&#8217;s martyrdom. While hunting
here one day in the late summer, he had come upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
this cave, and explored it. The beds of heather were
still piled up as Agatha had left them, and on one of
these the young man gently laid his burden down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is that old dog of a Jew?&#8221; he shouted;
&#8220;has he played me false!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, I am here, good sir, kind sir; and a broken-hearted
father. Woe is me! that ever I left my own
people; but I was tempted to come in the train of a
Roman, with wife and daughter and two noble boys.
All, all are dead&mdash;and I&mdash;whither shall I flee?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out of Britain as fast as may be,&#8221; said
Claudius, &#8220;and take this maiden as your daughter.
Make for the coast, and board a ship which is to
cross to Gaul; here are nine gold pieces for thy
pouch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But my daughter, my Rachel!&#8221; moaned the old
man. &#8220;Wilt thou give her body burial&mdash;burial, not
heathenish burning? Vow, young man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If possible, I will have her body thrown into a
hole, if you deem that to be a higher fate than burning;
but I do not promise. And now I must be gone.
Take two hours&#8217; rest, and then away before day
dawns. You know these parts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, but too well,&#8221; the old man said. &#8220;This hard
rugged Britain, and its rough people. I would that
I had never been tempted by the thought of goodly
merchandise to cross the sea&mdash;the angry sea&mdash;and
suffer thereby the bitter loss of all I count dear!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare say you have managed to get together a
few pearls. I mind hearing of some of your race who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
carried off the biggest pearls from the river on which
Londinium is built, and in conducting the barter with
the Britons for their masters,<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> well filled their own
pouches, as I dare to say yours is filled. Now I must
away. Ebba, remember I have fulfilled my vow at the
risk of my life; and if ever you see the fair Hyacintha
commend me to her with these words, &#8216;I have kept
my vow, and when she makes prayers to the goddess
in the temple where her presence lingers, bid her
remember Claudius.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>When Claudius was gone the Jew carefully stowed
away the coins in his pouch, and drew from it some
dried fruit and a small vial of mead. Then he said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Daughter, for I am to call thee daughter in place
of her who is in Abraham&#8217;s bosom&mdash;better there than
in this cold world; come and eat, before we go on our
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>At first Anna refused to eat and drink, but then
she remembered the words of Agatha:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be that the Lord has work for thee to do
for Him, and He spares thy life to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a pause, therefore, she roused herself, and
in the dim light which the waning moon shed through
the aperture, she saw the Jew&#8217;s face&mdash;a face lined
with furrows, and giving the appearance of a very old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
man, while, in truth, Ezra was scarcely sixty. Poor
Anna felt that she need not fear the old man, and as
she saw tears coursing each other down his cheeks
she drew nearer to him.</p>



<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I would fain eat, as you desire,
and live to help and comfort you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ezra shook his head from side to side, rocking
himself to and fro, after the fashion of his people.</p>

<p>&#8220;None can comfort and none can help, but I am
as well pleased to have thy company as to be solitary.
He setteth the solitary in families,&#8221; the old man said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you a Christian?&#8221; Anna asked, timidly.</p>

<p>She was surprised at the fierce denial that the Jew
hurled at her. &#8220;A Christian! nay. If you mean a
follower of the Nazarene&mdash;nay, by the Holy Father, I
say <i>nay</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Frightened at the sudden change from calm sorrow
to vehement rage, Anna said no more.</p>

<p>Ezra handed her the vial and the dried fruit, and
bade her eat and drink, and said in the strength of
that meal they must pursue their way, and that the
youth bade them not delay.</p>

<p>Before three o&#8217;clock the old man and the maiden
were on their journey eastward, making their way to
the sea. When day dawned, they were about five
miles from Radburn, and Ezra halted by a spring,
and, stooping down, took a draught of the pure cold
water in the hollow of his hand, bidding Anna do the
same. Then the Jew drew out more dried fruit;
and they reached a straggling village of mud dwellings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
about noon. The people were friendly, and Ezra
thought it wise to tarry there for the rest and refreshment
of his companion, who was, indeed, but the
ghost of the Ebba whom we first saw standing by
Cæcilia&#8217;s couch.</p>

<p>Ezra drew from his wallet a variety of articles,
and giving Anna a handkerchief of soft white stuff,
bordered with gold, he bade her bind it on her head
and confine her hair under it.</p>

<p>&#8220;No daughter of our race had ever hair so light
in colour,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and it is better that thou shouldst
take the semblance of my daughter&mdash;my Rachel&mdash;my
flower of beauty. Eheu! Eheu! She had borne up
so long, but, weak and ailing, she tripped and fell on
Watling Street, striking her head upon the stones of
the highway, and scarcely spoke a word after. I bore
her in my arms to a house in Verulam; but they were
rough and cruel barbarians, and turned us out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I thought to reach Radburn, where I knew
the people were more friendly; and hearing a small
body of Roman soldiers were guarding some prisoners
there, I essayed to ascend the steps to the guard-house,
and here my child struggled hard for breath.
I sat me down with her, and then all was still&mdash;her
spirit had departed, and Ichabod is my name!&#8221;</p>

<p>Anna had heard of the Jewish race, and knew that
her Lord had been born of them. She knew, also, that
the Jews had crucified Him, and that the Cross had
been set on a hill in their city. Once she remembered
to have seen a man richly clothed in long garments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and heard that he had come with merchandise
and pearls to the Roman nobles. He was one of the
scattered people, who, like the Greeks, were sometimes
conveyed to Britain in the train of the Romans.
But Anna knew little about the Jews. Agatha had,
indeed, while rehearsing in her ears many of the instructions
which had fallen from the lips of Amphibalus
and Heraclius, told her of the Jews&#8217; city, Jerusalem,
and how the Romans held the province as they
held Britain; and that the Jews, as a punishment for
their sins, were sent forth to wander restlessly over
the face of the earth. But all this time a Jew was
seldom seen in Britain except as an appendage of
some great person, so that Anna had never seen other
Jews besides the man in the rich garment, of whom
she heard afterwards that he had been robbed of his
treasures and slain on the highway, no one interfering
to save or protect him.</p>

<p>Her heart was filled with strange doubts as she
heard the Jew, who denounced her Saviour with fury,
pray to his Lord Jehovah, and chant in a low monotone
from a roll of parchment which he kept hidden
in the breast of his robe, and fastened by a band
round his neck. The low, monotonous chant was one
of the Psalms of David&mdash;the Penitential Psalm&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;Out of the deep have I called.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the Hebrew rhythm, though pleasant to the ear,
was an unknown tongue to the British maiden, and
while Ezra chanted and wept, Anna, soothed, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
scarcely knew why, rested on a skin which was spread
upon the floor of the hut, and slept till Ezra awoke
her and said they must push on towards the sea.</p>

<p>Fatigue and hunger, and weariness of body and
mind, had dulled the sense of pain for the time; but
when her powers were more fully awake, the hideous
scenes of the stoning of Amphibalus, the mad shouts
of the people, and the darkness of the dungeon, became
once more a haunting reality. Then came the
bitter fear of what might have been the fate of Agatha,
her tender friend, who had been left fainting and ill
in darkness and solitude with the dead, while she,
who had shared so many dangers with her, was borne
away. She reproached herself for cowardice, and in
broken words, with many tears, prayed the Jew to let
her return towards Radburn.</p>

<p>But Ezra was proof against her entreaties, and
bade her thank Jehovah for the life He had spared;
nor waste strength and time in feeble wailings.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have lost my only one,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the only
thing left to me in this land of strangers; but I go on
towards Rome, the great city, where a company of
my people is gathered, and thence to Jerusalem to lay
my bones where the prophets and righteous men have
laid theirs; nor will I weakly faint or fail of my purpose.
I was on my way to the sea coast when this
misfortune befel me, to find by chance a little company,
with whom my child and I might be protected
through Gaul. We push on thither now, and may the
Almighty be our strong tower and house of defence.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>This prayer was answered, and the longing fulfilled;
the Jew and the maiden were mercifully protected
from harm.</p>

<p>Their quiet, inoffensive bearing, their sorrowful
faces and gentle demeanour, served as a shield as
they passed through the widely-scattered villages of
the old Britons and the more pretentious towns of their
conquerors the Romans. They reached the fort of
Lyme in safety, and Claudius&#8217;s gold pieces purchased
their passage across the stormy channel in one of those
strangely-built boats, with large curved prow and short
mast, which had taken the place of the mud-lined
coracles of the conquered race.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small>BY LAND AND SEA.</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> party under the convoy of Burrhus had embarked
from Lyme, in Dorsetshire, very soon after
Alban&#8217;s martyrdom. The remains of the old harbour,
although at a distance from the sea, which has receded
from this part of the coast, can still be seen by
those who may be curious to discover them. The
channel had been smooth, for a great gale had passed
over it some days before, and the weather was exceptionally
calm and favourable.</p>

<p>The pain of parting was over, and Hyacintha
and her brother gave themselves up to the full enjoyment
of travel, unthinking of the dangers which in
reality threatened them, and delighting in the thought
that every day brought them nearer to Rome.</p>

<p>There was also in Hyacintha&#8217;s child-heart a strange
yearning for the office for which she was to be trained
under her kinswoman. Years must pass, she knew,
before the care of that sacred fire could really be entrusted
to her, but the time would come, and then
what life on earth could be found to compare to it?
Had Hyacintha lived in our day, she would have had
the same visions and dreams of a vocation higher
than that which is pursued year by year by those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
live only for the present. In the higher rank of society,
which corresponds to that in which our little Hyacintha
was born, there is the same imperative demand made
for all that can conduce to pleasure.</p>

<p>The London season of to-day, with its ceaseless
round of gaiety, its slavish adherence to prevailing
customs, the glare and false brilliancy of the life of
the votaries of fashion, is found quite insufficient for
many who are caught in the vortex and hurried along
the stream, to be carried they have scarcely time to
ask whither.</p>

<p>The human heart, with all its joys and sorrows, is
the same in the nineteenth as it was in the fourth
century.</p>

<p>The surroundings may be different, and this difference
in outside things is likely to make us look upon
the men and women of a remote age as apart from
us, and forget that they had their cares, and joys, and
hopes, and fears, as we have them now.</p>

<p>The woman&#8217;s heart then, as now, often sent up a
cry for something that could satisfy it; and half-unconsciously
to herself that cry was making itself heard in
Hyacintha&#8217;s young heart, like the first notes of a bird
sent forth to meet the dawn.</p>

<p>All travelling was long and dangerous in those
times. The tribes of Gaul&mdash;the Burgundæ&mdash;had
risen in 287, and Carausius, who had carried all
before him for ten years in Britain, had once been
amongst them.</p>

<p>The troop which Burrhus commanded did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
pass through the country without several fierce encounters
with the Burgundæ, and the women were
terror-struck with the clash of arms, and the savage
cries of the wild bands which again and again attacked
them. The wife of Burrhus was attended by
several ladies and slaves, and Hyacintha and Casca
each had their own attendant. Hyacintha&#8217;s was a
girl of Roman birth, who thought it an honour to be
the servant of a young aspirant to the office of a
priestess in the temple of Vesta.</p>

<p>In one of the most alarming encounters Casca was
wounded in the shoulder. His father had given
Burrhus instructions to lose no opportunity of hardening
his son, and to do everything that might make
him worthy to be a Roman soldier, so that he was
placed in the front rank of this skirmish.</p>

<p>Poor Casca suffered terribly from his wound,
though in the eyes of the soldiers it was but a trifling
one.</p>

<p>His sensitive organism, so widely different from
that of the big and burly Burrhus, excited contempt
rather than pity, and as it was a drag upon their movements
to have to carry a litter with a wounded man,
Burrhus determined to embark his troop on board
two Roman galleys which were lying in the port of
Marseilles, and perform the rest of the journey by
water.</p>

<p>This plan was hailed gladly by the ladies of the
party, and especially by Hyacintha, who could sit
continually by her brother, as he lay on the deck of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the galley, and talk to him, or be silent, as he liked;
but Casca was gloomy and sad, and lamented that
the spear of the wild warrior who had overpowered
him had not made an end of him altogether.</p>

<p>The galley was lying one evening off the coast of
that part of southern France and northern Italy we
know as the Riviera.</p>

<p>Beyond the rugged outline of the rocky range,
lofty mountains rose&mdash;the peaks of eternal snow, the
white-crowned line of the Alpes Maritimes. The evening
was fair and calm, and the sails of the galley
hung idly in the gentle breeze.</p>

<p>Hyacintha&#8217;s soul was filled with the beauty before
her, and Casca&#8217;s large mournful eyes were turned towards
the snowy peaks, now blushing rosy-red with
the last kiss of the setting sun.</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; Casca said, &#8220;looks like the city Ebba
murmured about. I never could make out where it
was, nor how it was to be reached. Poor Ebba!&#8221; he
repeated. &#8220;I wonder if she is dead, like Alban, and
passed hence? and if so, whither?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hyacintha did not reply. She was looking down
upon the sapphire water which rippled against the
low, cumbrous vessel, and her eyes were scanning a
dark object which floated slowly past.</p>

<p>&#8220;See, Casca!&#8221; she said, &#8220;see! There are dead
women in that boat, drifting whither?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As we drift,&#8221; said the boy, raising himself on his
elbow, &#8220;as we drift. But I heard some one say that
the people of these parts place their dead that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
love best in boats, that they may reach Arles&mdash;the
holy city&mdash;with money to pay for their burial.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hyacintha did not answer, but continued to gaze
down upon the boat till it was carried beyond her
sight.</p>

<p>Death everywhere, the child thought. Death by
sword, and fire, and tempest, and sickness. Death!
and she had heard Ebba say something about One
who was the Life. Life was so beautiful, and so sweet,
and yet the shadow of death was everywhere.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be beyond the sights and sounds of woe
and trouble in the temple,&#8221; she thought. &#8220;I shall
have so many beautiful things about me, and I shall
forget all that is dark and dreadful.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the sun went down, a cool brisk breeze sprang
up, and the little convoy, of which the ship in which
the brother and sister were sailing was the middle
one, began to dance merrily on the water.</p>

<p>The galley on board of which were Burrhus and
the chief officers of the maniple was the scene of
feasting and merriment.</p>

<p>There were sounds of music, and of voices singing,
and nothing seemed to depress or sadden the rest of
the party.</p>

<p>&#8220;How different they are from me,&#8221; Casca said.
&#8220;Do not you wish to join them in the other vessel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, brother, you know I love best to be with
you,&#8221; Hyacintha said, &#8220;but I would fain see you
happier. Be not so faint-hearted; think of Rome,
and all you will see and do there; and how proud I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
shall feel when I hear of my brother as foremost
in all things in which young and noble Romans
excel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, little sister, I crave only for peace and
study. I know full well that, by my father&#8217;s orders, I
shall be hunted about at Rome, as I have been at
Verulam, and I shall have no Claudius to cheer me
and help me there. I marvel much, Hyacintha, what
has become of Ebba. If the faith of the Christian
should be the real faith! It seemeth to give the
weak strength and the faint-hearted courage, and for
that alone it should be the faith for such as me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hyacintha turned quickly from her contemplation
of the water, and said, brightly&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, but Casca, there are brave and courageous
ones who follow the old faith; you forget that everyone
is not sad, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A coward like me&#8221;&mdash;Casca finished the sentence.
&#8220;A coward like me! Well, little sister, you have
courage enough for both. I hate bloodshed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Casca! Think you that I love to see it?
When my mother made me sit with her, when the
wild boars and bulls were let loose on those poor
slaves in the arena at Verulam, I hid my eyes. It is
not that sort of courage I mean. I mean, courage for
great and noble things. When the wild barbarians
fell on our troop near Arles, I shuddered. And
oh, Casca! when I saw thee brought in, bleeding so
terribly, I could scarce bear it. I shall be glad to be
in Rome, safe in the Vestal&#8217;s atrium, where I am to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
learn all that befits a priestess of the beautiful goddess
Vesta. I dream of her; and she comes to me in
white robes. I saw her last night walking on the sea&mdash;so
calm and beautiful&mdash;and on her head burned a
star, like that,&#8221; the child said, pointing to a planet
which was setting in the eastern heaven, and shone
with a steady radiance in the opal sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;The dangers of the way are nearly over now,
and then it will be Rome, and I shall be learning all
that I could never learn in Verulam.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And have you no longings for our mother and
our father? I, who did not love them, or seem to be
loved by them as you were, I have longings. Our
beautiful mother and our noble father! He was hard
enough on me&mdash;stern and hard&mdash;but then, while it is
a gift of the gods to have a beautiful daughter like
thee, Hyacintha, it is a curse for a brave man to have
a weakling like me for an only son.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hyacintha was silent for a minute, and then said,</p>

<p>&#8220;If they had wanted me sorely it would have been
hard to part, but my mother did not want me. Even
Ebba was more to her than I was. And my father&#8217;s
desire was that I should be a chosen priestess, as
many of his race have been before; therefore, I am
content. And it may be that our parents will return
to Rome, if it be the great Emperor&#8217;s will&mdash;all he
wills comes to pass. It was his will that the Christians
should be put to death, and who could gainsay
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Two of the attendants now came to spread the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
evening meal under a canvas canopy, which bore
upon it the picture of an eagle with outstretched
wings. This sheltering canopy was made of the most
beautiful and costly material in the ships which
belonged to any great Roman noble. Even that of
Burrhus was of purple silk with an embroidered edge,
but the other two small galleys were less costly in
their furnishings, and Hyacintha slept in the superior
vessel, only boarding the other in the day-time that
she might be near her brother.</p>

<p>This vessel was under the command of a Roman
named Caius, who was a fine, noble-looking man, of
few words; but who, nevertheless, had conceived a
great interest in the two children of the noble house
who were under the care of Burrhus.</p>

<p>He now drew near, and asked Hyacintha whether
she and her attendant would repair to the galley of
Burrhus, or remain on board to partake of the evening
meal with Casca.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would fain stay here,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;till the
merriment is over there. The loud voices and music
drown the sweet ripple of the water against the prow,
which I love to hear. And, moreover, good Caius,&#8221;
Hyacintha said, &#8220;I feel safer aboard your vessel from
the pirates&#8217; attacks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caius&#8217;s dark eyes were fixed on a spot in the
horizon, and he did not reply. He stood motionless
at the prow, gazing out in the same direction, till the
moon, nearly at the full, lifted her round face above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the distant horizon, and sent a flood of silvery light
across the water which seemed to come straight to
the spot where the galley was curtseying on the rising
waves.</p>

<p>A dark speck upon the line of light was now
visible to all eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that a Roman galley?&#8221; Casca asked.</p>

<p>Before he could get an answer, Caius had given
the word for all sails to be set.</p>

<p>Then he went to the prow, and shouted to those
in Burrhus&#8217;s galley that the foe was nearing them
fast.</p>

<p>&#8220;All sails set,&#8221; was shouted back from the third
galley.</p>

<p>And then much trampling and confusion and noise
were heard on board Burrhus&#8217;s ship. There had been
free circulation of the wine cup, and it was difficult to
get those who were drowsy from drink to perform their
office.</p>

<p>The sailors were all at cross purposes, and the
officers on board shouting their orders, and countermanding
them as soon as given.</p>

<p>Meantime, there could be no further doubt of the
intentions of the large ship which was bearing down
upon them.</p>

<p>There was not a moment to lose, and Caius, having
his men under orders, with all sails set, drove before
the wind, speedily increasing the distance between his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
ship and that of Burrhus and the small galley behind
it, which contained the baggage of the maniple.</p>

<p>There was only one large pirate vessel; and, probably
concluding that the Roman galley with the
richer awning contained the more important people,
it tacked, and, giving up the pursuit of Caius&#8217;s galley,
came alongside that of Burrhus, who was unprepared
to defend himself.</p>

<p>Cries and shouts, and the clang of weapons, came
borne upon the waters; and as the gallant little ship
commanded by Caius increased the distance between
the vessels, Casca and Hyacintha stood hand-in-hand
on the prow, watching in the bright moonlight the
conflict which was evidently raging.</p>

<p>Just as Caius&#8217;s ship had rounded the point which
now marks the frontier at Ventimiglia, the pirate vessel
was seen skimming the waters with her head set out
to sea, while Burrhus&#8217;s vessel and the small galley
were evidently fastened to the victorious cruiser, and
soon became but specks on the distant line of blue
waters.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have escaped,&#8221; said Caius, &#8220;but I fear me all
your baggage is lost; and as for me, I have lost all
but honour. I have saved one galley, and had the
fellows on board Burrhus&#8217;s ship been sober, and not
drunk, I could have rescued them also. Now they will
be seen no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were lives lost, think you?&#8221; said Casca.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, if they made a fight for life, they would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
hewn down by those swarthy Moors&mdash;for Moors they
were. They have the sharpest scimitars of any nation
under heaven, and strong arms to wield them. You
are bound for Rome, methinks?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! yes,&#8221; said Hyacintha; &#8220;I am going to be sent
to the noble Terentia Rufilla, the Vestal Maxima, in
the temple of the goddess; but my brother was to have
remained with Burrhus, and now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fret not for him,&#8221; said Caius. &#8220;I can bestow him
in my home&mdash;a humble one, it may be&mdash;till orders
can be received from the Governor of Britain or your
father, the noble Severus; and I will conduct you and
your attendant to the palace of the vestals. But we
are not at Rome yet; there is a long voyage before us,
though with this fresh wind and fair weather, we
ought to make the Portus Augusti in a few days. We
must make the best of it,&#8221; Caius added, &#8220;but I fear
the accommodation on board my vessel is not what
the fair Hyacintha has a right to expect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; Hyacintha said, &#8220;what will be the fate
of Burrhus and all the people with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, I cannot tell a maiden of thy tender age of
all I fear may befall them, especially the women of
the band. Let us thank the gods that thou art safe,
and thy brother also, who looks little fitted to bear
the brunt of war.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know Rome well?&#8221; Casca asked. &#8220;I pray
you tell me if I shall find it easy to frequent a school
of learning there. Now that I am free of Burrhus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
though I wish him no ill, yet I do feel that I lose a
hard master. It is learning for which I crave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thy craving for learning can be satisfied, boy,&#8221;
said Caius, &#8220;as all things can be satisfied in Rome.
Rome holds within her hand all that her sons and
daughters can need, be it for war, or fame, or pleasure,
or learning. There is a school, kept by one Cassius,
who may receive you for learning by day; and as for
a home, I have a poor little villa not far from the
schools, where my good mother lives, and there, as I
have said, you will be welcome till the good pleasure
of your father, the noble Severus, is known. For myself,
I must present myself before the Emperor&#8217;s
minions and report the loss of the chief part of the
maniple under Burrhus, and the capture of the large
galley and the small baggage vessel by the swart
African pirates.</p>

<p>&#8220;May the gods protect us from further attacks from
them! I did not forget to sacrifice to Neptune before
we set sail. I think I was the only man who did so
propitiate the god; and see how he has rewarded me!
Ay, it is beyond a doubt that no sacrifice or libation
poured out is in vain; and here I have proved it, as
my good mother will be glad to hear. She is one
who is always amongst the first in the temples at grand
ceremonies, and the very sight of you, fair maiden,
about to be vowed to the highest service, will fill her
old heart with pride that she is allowed to touch your
hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>&#8220;And now it is time for rest. Your couch, and
that of your slave, is made ready; and if Neptune and
Æolus deign to favour us, we shall be well on our
voyage ere you open your eyes on another day.&#8221;</p>

<small>ROME.</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are many travellers in the present day who,
when they reach Rome, and exchange the railway for
an omnibus, feel a throb of disappointment.</p>

<p>The &#8220;eternal city&#8221; of their dreams vanishes for the
moment into thin air, and in place of it there is only
a modern town, where the voices of the great past are
lost in the noise and din of the present.</p>

<p>But the Rome upon which the eyes of Casca and
Hyacintha gazed with intense wonder, on the September
afternoon of 303, may hardly be adequately
described, even by the aid of those wonderful discoveries
which the zeal and untiring exertions of
exploring labourers in the work of excavation have
lately brought to light.</p>

<p>There has been, indeed, a partial resurrection of
the buried Rome; the city lying beneath the heaped-up
excrescences of a degenerate age has been unearthed.
We can now dimly picture the glories of the noble
Forum, with its temples and statues, the long stretch
of the Appian Way, and the vast and almost illimitable
proportions of the Circus Maximus, with its belt of
distant mountains, and over all the cloudless sky, which
seemed, on this glowing autumn day, to be hanging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
like one great canopy of celestial blue over the city
set upon her seven hills.</p>

<p>The good Caius had taken the tired boy and girl
to his mother&#8217;s house, as he had promised, with their
two attendants. The stately old Roman matron received
her son with a smile of welcome; and as they
stood in the little atrium, uncertain what to do, she
advanced to Casca and Hyacintha, and bade them
welcome to enter, and rest for a season.</p>

<p>Caius, in a few words, related the events of the
past few weeks; and when he came to the encounter
with the pirates, and the deliverance of the small
galley under his command, Cl&#339;lia clasped her hands,
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neptune has been pleased to receive my offerings,
made daily for you, my son, since you left me
for the region of the barbarian, now three years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, good mother, we speak not of barbarians
now in Britain. Verulam is a little Rome, and as fair
a daughter of our great mother as you can picture.
The villa of Severus, which is the home of this fair
maiden and her brother, is scarcely to be excelled
here in all its furnishings and appointments, though,
of course, less in size and extent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cl&#339;lia led Hyacintha and her attendant to a small
chamber, separated from her own by a curtain, and
Caius took Casca, who was still weakened by the
effects of his wound, to his own apartments, which in
his absence were always prepared for his return at any
moment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>Caius&#8217;s position answered to that of a naval officer
of our time; he was sent out with the troops for foreign
service when a galley was required, and he was,
as we have seen, an able commander of a vessel in
time of danger.</p>

<p>Casca and Hyacintha remained two days in the
home of Cl&#339;lia, and it was agreed that Cl&#339;lia should
accompany Hyacintha to the house of the vestals on
the third day.</p>

<p>The child&#8217;s heart was filled with wonder as she
passed through the streets of Rome with her new
friend.</p>

<p>All her worldly possessions had been carried off
by the pirates, and there was therefore nothing for her
to carry to the Vestals&#8217; house.</p>

<p>It was a grand event in Cl&#339;lia&#8217;s life to think of
presenting herself there, and inquiring for the Vestal
Maxima. For these vestals were looked upon as beings
of a superior order, and far above the usual rank of
Roman women.</p>

<p>Cl&#339;lia had donned her best robe, which was plain
in colour and material, and had no embroidery or
ornament except the purple segmentum, which is the
badge of widowhood. Cl&#339;lia wore a veil over her
silvery hair, and walked with the graceful dignity
which distinguished the Roman matron.</p>

<p>As they passed along Cl&#339;lia pointed out to Hyacintha
the principal objects of interest, and paused at
the Forum, where a variety of business and some religious
rites were going on.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>A sacrifice was being offered before the temple of
Dioscuri, and a large car, drawn by milk-white horses,
and preceded by a band of girls and boys playing on
silver trumpets, was followed by a large crowd.</p>

<p>Cl&#339;lia paused by one of the huge pillars, which
seemed to lift its head to the very skies, and bade
Hyacintha look round at the grand statues and buildings
which were on every side.</p>

<p>From one rostrum an orator was speaking to a
listening crowd, and accompanied his oration with the
graceful action which kept up the rhythm of the
words as they left his lips, and attracted many to his
feet.</p>

<p>A large caravan rolled past, which seemed to attract
attention. From their post of observation at the
base of the pillar, Cl&#339;lia addressed a woman, a widow
like herself, and asked, nodding her head in the direction
of the caravan&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;More beasts for the arena?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; was the answer, &#8220;and more sport for them.
A whole body of Christians have been seized to-day
while burrowing like ants in their underground resort.
There will be good sport to-morrow or next day. Will
you not come with me to see it? They have two huge
Barbary lions in that caravan, six leopards, and a
panther that has already done to death two of his
keepers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there will be fine sport,&#8221; the woman repeated,
her dark eyes flashing with a cruel light. &#8220;Ah!
They have caught another. See! Two!&mdash;three more!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Look! they are trying to escape; they are seized by
the lictors. One looks as if she would be a sweet
mouthful for the lion. I must hasten to find out who
they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman turned away, and Hyacintha could
distinguish three figures being borne off by the guards,
one a girl of her own age, the others two older
women.</p>

<p>&#8220;They refused to do homage on their knees at the
sacrifice,&#8221; a voice said near them. &#8220;The vile wretches!
It seems they can never be stamped out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; laughed another man.</p>

<p>&#8220;They swarm like lizards on a sunny wall. They
say the Governor in Britain has done good service,
and several of the reptiles have been caught and made
an end of. The Emperor has vowed he will never
stop till he has got rid of the whole brood, and those
fellows in that caravan will be happy to carry out his
intentions!&#8221;</p>

<p>A laugh greeted this sally, and, as if in reply, a
loud roar from the captive lion sounded through the
Forum.</p>

<p>Then the laugh was repeated, and Cl&#339;lia and Hyacintha,
as they moved away, heard the cry of the
people answering the roar of the lions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Away with the Christians! to the lions let them
go! Away with them from the face of the earth! Away
with them!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hyacintha caught the cry, and there came back to
her thoughts of the hill-side outside her native city, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the earnest, watching gaze of Ebba, and of the news
of Alban&#8217;s death, which had been brought into the
atrium by her father.</p>

<p>And it was the same here in Rome; the Christians
must be killed; they must all be stamped out, like so
many &#8220;lizards on a sunny wall,&#8221; as the man had
said.</p>

<p>Death, then, was here&mdash;as everywhere&mdash;and was
lying like a shadow over the sunlit Forum, with all its
throngs of people, intent on business or pleasure.</p>

<p>The circular stalls of the bookseller and the scrolls
of popular authors attracted Hyacintha.</p>

<p>Then there were the keen-eyed, sharp-featured
money-lenders, seated at Medius Janus with their clerks
around them. Here might be seen young Romans,
who wasted life and substance in all the luxury and
folly of the baths, trying to raise loans at an enormous
rate of interest, some successful, departing with a jaunty
air, their slaves following them; others gathering their
robes about them and slinking off with a look of despair
in their faces, to plunge deeper and deeper
into the sea of self-indulgence and misery which it
caused.</p>

<p>Cl&#339;lia drew Hyacintha onward, for she saw she
attracted attention, and many bold dark eyes were
turned towards her.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must hasten,&#8221; she said; &#8220;let us skirt the Forum
to the left, where the crowd is less, and we shall
reach the House of the Vestals.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they got into a quieter thoroughfare those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
were passing gave way; then a body of lictors appeared,
and a most stately, queenlike figure, clothed
in a long stole, which reached to her feet, moved
through the street, with two female attendants.</p>

<p>The lady&#8217;s eye fell upon Hyacintha, whose remarkable
beauty was likely to arrest any one&#8217;s attention.
By a little movement of the foot-passengers, Hyacintha
was pushed out of the line of those who were standing
aside, and a lictor roughly called to her to&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand back!&#8221; touching her with no gentle hand
on the shoulder.</p>

<p>Then the lady paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; she said, &#8220;do not be rough with the
maiden;&#8221; and she looked down upon Hyacintha with
a smile, which seemed to raise her drooping spirits, as
the sun raises the head of a flower after a storm.</p>

<p>It was but momentary, and the lady passed on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is that beautiful lady?&#8221; Hyacintha asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is the Vestal Maxima, the very lady whom
you desire to see,&#8221; Cl&#339;lia said. &#8220;I dare not speak,
for the vestals must never be addressed by the commoner
folk when they walk abroad; they are always
guarded by lictors, as you see. But let us follow; we
shall reach the House of the Vestals in a short space
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; Hyacintha exclaimed, &#8220;I am glad that gracious
lady is my father&#8217;s kinswoman; her smile is so
beautiful. It is a great honour, I think, that I may
one day be a Vestal Maxima.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A long time ere that day comes,&#8221; said Cl&#339;lia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
&#8220;Ten years must pass ere you are allowed to take
any especial or high office in the temple, and then
it is not every vestal who attains the high rank of
Maxima.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Hyacintha, humbly. &#8220;I know that well,
but there is hope that it <i>may</i> be my honourable post
one day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cl&#339;lia nodded her head, and then Hyacintha,
feeling that the time of parting was near, said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I pray you to be kind to my brother Casca; he
is far tenderer than I am, and loves quiet and study.
As soon as Caius lets it be known to my father that
he is under your roof he will reward you, for he is a
noble, and can command money and treasures.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cl&#339;lia&#8217;s colour rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;I need not money or treasures,&#8221; she said, &#8220;nor
aught at thy father&#8217;s hands. Be not afraid, I will tend
thy sickly brother till his wound be healed, and Caius
will settle the rest. Our fare is simple, and we know
nought of the luxuries of the Romans of to-day. We
belong to a far stronger race, a race which I fear me
is dwindling down from giants to pigmies. I have,
thank the gods, a son who fears neither storm nor
tempest; sword nor famine. He is known as the bravest
of the brave, thank the gods!&#8221;</p>

<p>Cl&#339;lia&#8217;s speech made poor Hyacintha feel as if
she had said something that had unwittingly offended
her new friend. Her tender heart was a little wounded,
and she hastened to say&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know well how brave good Caius is. I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
that we owe our lives to him. If we had been aboard
Burrhus&#8217;s vessel, we should have perished. Oh yes!
I know how brave he is, and I shall keep the memory
of his goodness for ever in my heart. We shall meet
sometimes, for my father saith the young disciples of
the goddess have leave to come and go under guard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we shall meet,&#8221; Cl&#339;lia said, &#8220;but there is a
great gulf between a vestal and one in my position.
We are nearly at the porch of the cloisters now. What
if they do not receive thee?&#8221;</p>

<p>The possibility now presented itself that in the
travel-stained little maiden, whose robe was far from
fresh, and whose chief covering and ornament were
her golden-brown tresses tied back by a plait to which
hung a veil that had been drenched with sea spray
and torn in several places, the grand lady vestal
might not recognise a child of the noble and wealthy
Severus. But it was too late now to draw back. They
had crossed the threshold of the cloisters, and two
guards demanded their business.</p>

<p>&#8220;We seek an audience with the noble lady,
Terentia Rufilla, the Vestal Maxima.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What credentials have you?&#8221; asked a small
woman in a purple robe and dark veil.</p>

<p>&#8220;I come from my father, the noble Severus, of the
house of Rufilla,&#8221; Hyacintha said, in her sweet silvery
tones. &#8220;I am to be admitted to be a disciple of the
goddess, to serve in her temple.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forsooth, you are bold enough,&#8221; said the woman,
who called to another in the same dress.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>&#8220;Here, Julia, here! This child says she is come
to be admitted to the discipleship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Send her off,&#8221; was the scornful reply; &#8220;she looks
like it, forsooth. Verily, send her off, nor waste thy
own time in prating. Why, child, those who aspire to
such an office as this do not come to present themselves
like beggars.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hyacintha&#8217;s breast heaved, and tears sprang to her
eyes.</p>

<p>Cl&#339;lia now spoke&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The maiden has suffered perils on the way from
Britain. She was brought with her brother to my
house three days ago. The ships were beset by pirates,
and everything the maiden possessed is lost. My son,
the brave Caius, brought a small galley safe into the
Portus Augusti a few days past, and he can tell you
of the truth of my story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wear upon my breast,&#8221; Hyacintha faltered, &#8220;a
pierced gold coin attached to a chain. This coin
bears on it the letters of my father&#8217;s house, and his
name.</p>

<p>&#8220;I bore with me,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;a letter and
many precious things addressed to the great lady,
Terentia Rufilla, but the pirate ship boarded that on
which my baggage was placed, and I reached Rome
in a sorry plight.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was now a very perceptible change in the
manner of the two women. The family of Rufilla was
one to win respect, and the elder said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will it please you to follow me?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>These words were addressed to Hyacintha, and
she was about to obey when the sound of steps in the
long cloisters made the women turn. And there,
coming from the shadows into the dim light where
they stood, was the same graceful, dignified lady who
had passed by them on their way from the Forum.
Terentia Rufilla was no longer young&mdash;indeed, it was
impossible for the virgins to attain the highest office
at a very early age. Ten years had to pass as a noviciate,
and ten more was generally considered as a
necessary probation before the honour of Vestal Maxima
could be aspired to.</p>

<p>The servants and attendants all bowed low as the
lady approached, and Hyacintha&#8217;s heart beat so loudly
that she could almost hear it.</p>

<p>&#8220;What brings you hither, my daughter?&#8221; the lady
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the daughter of Severus, of the house of
Rufilla,&#8221; said the little maiden. &#8220;I crave to be
admitted to the service of the temple, and my
father has sent me hither from the city of Verulam
in Britain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thy father! Yes, a post brought in despatches
from Verulam yesternight, and there was a letter from
thy father, Severus. Welcome, my daughter,&#8221; the lady
said, bending over the little shrinking figure. &#8220;Welcome;
and I will receive thee here and examine thee
on some matters necessary to be known ere thy training
begin. How old art thou?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am eleven years old, lady,&#8221; Hyacintha said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>&#8220;Eleven! Ten is the accustomed age. Thy companions
have mostly entered upon their services at
ten, but we will not let that hinder us, if other matters
prove convenient. Is that good woman related to
thee?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, lady,&#8221; said Cl&#339;lia, advancing; and then,
encouraged by Terentia&#8217;s kindly manner, Cl&#339;lia drew
nearer, and, bowing low, kissed the hand extended
to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;And canst thou tell me aught of this maiden?&#8221;
Terentia asked.</p>

<p>Cl&#339;lia, in a few words, gave the account of the
perils by sea which the maniple under Burrhus had
met. She did not forget to extol the merits of her
son Caius, and to let it be known that by his skilful
seamanship one galley had been saved. &#8220;The maiden
has lost everything she possessed; because her sick,
weakly, brother was aboard my son&#8217;s galley, and she
spent the days with him, and returned to the vessel
of Burrhus by night under the care of his lady Cornelia.
The pirate attacked them at sundown, and
soon overpowered the men under Burrhus, while
Caius, seeing it hopeless to help men in their cups,
and fearing this maiden might meet a fate worse than
death, set his little vessel&#8217;s head to the breeze and
escaped.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lady listened with courteous attention, and
then taking Hyacintha&#8217;s hand, she said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will now receive her into the house of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
vestals consecrated to the service of the goddess.
Has she an attendant?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Hyacintha exclaimed, &#8220;I have one attendant,
but she remains at the house of the good
Cl&#339;lia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so may she remain. Of what nation is she&mdash;a
Briton?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, gracious lady,&#8221; Hyacintha said, &#8220;she is of
Roman birth, and her family are to be found here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seek them out then,&#8221; said the Vestal, &#8220;and let
her return to them. I must commit thee, child, to the
care of those who will clothe thee in the proper habit,
and to-morrow at dawn thou shalt be led to our
high priest, who shall examine thee, and then consecrate
thee for thy high office in the temple of the
goddess.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cl&#339;lia understood that the time for leaving
Hyacintha was come, and she bade her farewell,
making a low reverence to the stately lady, who,
taking Hyacintha by the hand, was leading her away,
when she turned quickly&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I pray you, Cl&#339;lia, commend me to my brother
Casca, and let me know of his welfare. I pray you
assure him of my affection.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It shall be as you desire,&#8221; Cl&#339;lia said, as she
turned to pursue her way towards her home on the
further side of the Forum.</p>

<p>Hyacintha was led through the cloisters, up a
staircase by which the upper floor was reached, to a
small hall where several vestals were seated, employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
in weaving a fine tissue embroidered with gold and
silver, which was used for the service of the altar.</p>

<p>As the Vestal Maxima entered the hall the sound
of voices ceased, and the maidens rose as a token of
respect.</p>

<p>&#8220;I desire to speak with Lucia, who is the custodian
of the robes. I need the garments for this young girl,
who is the daughter of the noble Severus of my own
patrician house, and who is sent hither from the wilds
of Britain, to be restored to the high rank her family
has ever held in Rome.&#8221; Then turning to Lucia, who
had answered a summons from an inner hall, separated
by a heavy purple curtain from the larger one, the
Vestal Maxima continued&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take this maiden, and clothe her in becoming
garments, Lucia. See that she rests well and has
proper food, and just before dawn, when I am leaving
the temple, bring her to my presence, where she will
meet the priest and be received as a disciple. Till
then,&#8221; she said, waving her hand, &#8220;I give her into
your keeping.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hyacintha was a little surprised at the change in
the manner and bearing of the maidens the instant
their superior was out of hearing.</p>

<p>They had stood in respectful silence, with their
silks and threads in their hands, and their tongues,
like their fingers, had come to a pause. But both
were now in active operation again. They clustered
round Hyacintha, asking her questions, which she, from
imperfect acquaintance with the colloquial language<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
which they spoke, could hardly understand. It is true
that the Romans of noble birth in Britain had kept
most strictly to their native tongue, regarding the
British language as that of slaves. Still, there were
differences then, as now, in dialect&mdash;those differences
which we call provincial&mdash;and thus Hyacintha found
it far easier to understand the lady Terentia than
these vestal maidens, who were as yet only disciples,
and chattered in the fashion of young creatures in
every age and in every country, clustering round the
new arrival like a flock of pigeons round an addition
to the dovecot.</p>

<p>Lucia, who was older and more considerate, said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Peace, will you deafen the child with your rattle!
It is truly like the brawling of a brook down the hill-side.
Peace, and return to your tasks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dazed and bewildered, Hyacintha suffered Lucia
to lead her away, but when on the other side of the
purple curtain she began to breathe more freely.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are tired, child, and need rest,&#8221; Lucia said.
&#8220;See, I will measure you for a stole, and cut off your
hair, and then you shall have a refreshing bath, and
lie on one of the couches till it is time for supper.
After that meal is over I will fit your garments again
on you, and at dawn you shall be taken to the door
of the temple to meet the priest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hyacintha was quite passive under Lucia&#8217;s hands,
and as she operated on her she talked of the vestal&#8217;s
life, of the insubordination of some of the disciples,
of the serious defalcation of two professed vestals, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
of the fearful punishment which had been awarded
them.</p>

<p>Hyacintha listened with a mingled awe and amazement
to all she heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Lucia said, as one by one the golden-brown
tresses dropped to the marble floor. &#8220;Yes,
there have been terrible scenes amongst us, and I
often think that children like you, who come hither,
know but little of all that lies hidden within these
walls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Hyacintha, &#8220;is it not the most noble
and beautiful life for any woman to keep the sacred
fire for ever burning for the Roman people all over
the world. Surely, it is nobler and more beautiful
than to live only for things which when attained make
none happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Happy! Ah, my child, happiness is like the bow
across the wide Campagna. You see its many-coloured
arch and hasten to reach it, and, lo! it is gone; the
nearer you think you get to it, the further it seems.
But the gods are kind to us poor mortals, and our
goddess Vesta does not forget us. You are but a
child, a young child,&#8221; Lucia said, surveying Hyacintha
as she stood up before her in a loose underrobe, with
all her marvellously lovely hair gone, and the little
slender figure, beautifully formed, giving the appearance
of extreme youth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am nearly twelve years old!&#8221; Hyacintha said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twelve years old. Ah!&#8221; Lucia said, with an
appraising critical glance, &#8220;there is something in your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
eyes which tells of thought and reflection which a child
under ten years of age could not possess. And what
hands and feet! Only a Roman patrician could show
such. Well, if you are ready, we will go to the bath
that is always required before the stole can be worn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would fain keep the token of my birth, and
that I am the daughter of Severus,&#8221; Hyacintha said,
as she saw Lucia casting aside in a heap all her travel-stained
garments, and the chain which she had worn
round her neck with the coin attached to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know not whether you will be permitted to
retain it,&#8221; Lucia said, &#8220;but I will put it in this casket,
and consult the Vestal Maxima. And now let us go
to the bath.&#8221;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small>DISCIPLESHIP.</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Hyacintha</span> slept soundly after her bath, and a
supper of fruit and delicately-baked bread, crisp and
fresh, after the fashion of our modern biscuits. A
draught of the pure water from the spring on the hill
above the house of the vestals was refreshing, and it
was the daily duty of the vestals to draw it for the
service of the house and the temple.</p>

<p>Hyacintha was awoke by Lucia&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is nearing the dawn,&#8221; she said; &#8220;the cock has
crowed twice, and I see the first signs of Aurora&#8217;s
coming feet in the eastern sky. Now arise, little
maiden, and I will dress you for your presentation to
the priest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hyacintha sprang up at once, and after another
ablution of clear cold water, the attendant vestal put
upon her little feet a pair of sandals, and the fine
robe which she was to wear under the stole. The
stole itself and the fillet which was to bind her hair
the vestal placed in a basket, and then telling Hyacintha
to follow her, she led the way to the chamber
of Terentia Rufilla.</p>

<p>This chamber was nearly adjoining the temple,
and to reach it, it was necessary to descend again and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
cross the large atrium, now almost dark, except for
the faint light of a lamp which hung in the large
porta or gateway.</p>

<p>The sunshine could not reach this stately hall,
which consisted of eight Corinthian columns of veined
marble, with pure white bases.</p>

<p>The state apartments were on this lower storey of
the vestals&#8217; house, and as the floor was thirty feet
below the Nova Via, with the walls resting against
the Palatine, it must have been very damp and chill;
the pure air of heaven could never reach it; and in
spite of double walls, double floors, and hot-water
currents&mdash;of which distinct traces are left&mdash;it could
not have been a healthy abode.</p>

<p>The living rooms from which Hyacintha and Lucia
had descended were, perhaps, more salubrious, but the
Imperial Palace, rising at that time one hundred and
fifty feet above the building, must have always over-shadowed
the whole house, and prevented the light
from entering, as well as the air.</p>

<p>A heavy curtain was drawn aside by one of the
servants of the temple, and the next moment Hyacintha
found herself in the presence of the Vestal Maxima,
her father&#8217;s kinswoman.</p>

<p>She had been keeping watch that night in the
temple, and wore a different and more elaborate dress&mdash;as
the sign of her high vocation&mdash;than that in
which Hyacintha had seen her on the preceding
evening.</p>

<p>The Vestal Maxima wore a long stole of snow-white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
linen, drooping gracefully to her feet. A loose
hood, falling a little from the back of the head, displayed
a close-fitting cap, bound with gold fillets,
and lay in easy folds over her shoulders. A large
pallium, of a deep violet colour, was gathered over
her left arm, and wound closely round her waist.
Terentia Rufilla was in the autumn of her life, and
when the little novice made her profound reverence,
as Lucia had instructed her to do, a smile,
which was half pitying and half admiring, spread over
her noble countenance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Welcome, little maiden,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Thy name
is of Greek origin, and scarcely one to be registered
as a vestal. Was that name chosen by the noble
Severus?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know not, lady,&#8221; said Hyacintha. &#8220;Methinks
my mother chose it because she loved the flower and
its sweet scent, but I cannot tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will, perhaps, be better to register thy name
as Severa, and yet Hyacintha suits thee so well, I
think it must stand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hyacintha Severa, the daughter of the noble
Severus,&#8221; she said, waving her hand to the maidens;
&#8220;lead the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The maidens turned towards an entrance to the
chamber opposite to that by which Lucia had entered,
and as two of their number held the curtain aside,
the others passed through, chanting a low monotonous
song as they went.</p>

<p>The sun had risen now, and the sky above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
temple court was bright, and of the indescribably
lovely blue of early day.</p>

<p>The light fell upon the vestals&#8217; white garments till
they glistened like snow, and upon the short clustering
curls of little Hyacintha&#8217;s head till they shone
like gold.</p>

<p>The procession crossed the court and ascended
a flight of wide and very shallow steps, shadowed by
the portico, on which were seen, in bas-relief, many
figures, illustrating the past history of the vestals, from
the earliest date to the time of which I write.</p>

<p>A nation&#8217;s history was almost told by these figures,
to which Hyacintha did not even raise her eyes, so
engrossed was she with the first sight of the temple of
her dreams.</p>

<p>At last they were within the sacred building,
where in the gloom and shadows the sacred light of
the fire upon the altar shone like a star of glory.</p>

<p>Hyacintha had eyes for nothing but that light&mdash;that
clear lambent light&mdash;shed by the sacred and
never-to-be-extinguished fire, which had been brought
down from high heaven and preserved here by those
consecrated and set apart for the office.</p>

<p>The child&#8217;s heart thrilled with a sense of awe, and
a gentle sigh escaped her. She clasped her hands,
and looking up to the opening in the temple roof to
the clear azure sky, her eyes filled with tears, which
one by one fell upon her bare hands and arms in
crystal drops.</p>

<p>The Vestal Maxima noticed this unwonted expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
of feeling, and her thoughts went back to
the day&mdash;now thirty years ago&mdash;when she, too, had
entered the temple for the first time to be presented
to the priest.</p>

<p>The prime of youth was over for her; the &#8220;sacred
fire&#8221; had grown dim. The heavenly light and warmth
had, she knew, waned. At her noble heart there was
an aching void, and there was a hungry yearning for
something&mdash;for <i>some one</i>&mdash;which was not satisfied.
As she looked at the little earnest enthusiast by her
side, she wondered if all the long years of temple
service which stretched before her would be as barren
of real satisfaction and true peace as hers had been.</p>

<p>Terentia Rufilla saw at a glance that Hyacintha,
the daughter of Severus, was not of the ordinary type
of the maidens over whom she held rule. Many of
them came with no serious thought of responsibility;
many with positive distaste, and simply because the
vocation was chosen for them by their parents, and
they had no choice in the matter.</p>

<p>It was confessedly a grand office, this of the vestal
virgins, in the eyes of the world. To be a vestal
was to bear about the imprimatur of patrician birth
and noble ancestry. No plebeian might ever wear
that snow-white stole, or aspire to the high office of a
Vestal Maxima.</p>

<p>This pride of rank and personal aggrandisement
were often the distinguishing characteristics of the
vestal virgins. As they passed through the public
streets, the way was cleared for them by attendant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
lictors. If by chance they met a slave on his way to
the arena or the fire, and he prayed for mercy, the
vestal could procure his pardon. Her word was
enough, and the life of the criminal was spared!</p>

<p>All these things conspired to feed the self-importance
and vanity of many women; and then there
was their palatial atrium, and their own chambers,
which were furnished with all things befitting the
high rank of Roman ladies.</p>

<p>Terentia Rufilla had seen many of the proud ones
brought low, and the vain and frivolous ones made
shipwreck. The cases of the latter were rare, but
there had been such, even during her time of office,
and her heart might well be heavy as she thought
over them.</p>

<p>The beauty and rare simplicity of her little kinswoman
had touched her from the first moment of
their meeting, and now as she led her up to the old
priest, who was awaiting them in a side vestibule,
she felt a yearning tenderness and love for Hyacintha
which made her silvery voice almost mournful as she
said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I bring you the daughter of the noble Severus,
to be consecrated for the service of the goddess and
of Rome, in this temple.&#8221;</p>

<p>The priest, an old man, who had received the
candidates for many, many years, went through the
usual form of questions as to Hyacintha&#8217;s willingness
to take the solemn oath he tendered to her.</p>

<p>The child understood but little of the meaning of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
much that was said to her, but she knew that the
penalty was death if she should break her vow.</p>

<p>As she knelt before the old priest her childlike
transparent soul received no impression but that she
was never to have any other home than the temple;
and she wished for no other. She was to learn to
spin and weave the sacred curtains and veils for the
altar, and she desired nothing better.</p>

<p>She was to submit herself entirely to the rule of
the Vestal Maxima and those of the sacred virgins
whom she should appoint to watch over her and
instruct her. She was to be under training for eight
or ten years, as the Vestal Maxima should see good,
and then her full consecration would take place, and
she would take her turn in watching in the temple at
night and feeding the sacred fire&mdash;which only the
fully consecrated were ever allowed to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, beloved,&#8221; the priest said, &#8220;Hyacintha,
the daughter of the noble Severus, I give thee entrance
as a disciple, to be educated for a vestal priestess, to
minister in sacred things, and to do for the Roman
people what the law has appointed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Hyacintha took the vow in the prescribed
form, and, rising, the Vestal Maxima invested her
with the stole, and bound a purple fillet round her
head; then bending with an irresistible impulse, she
kissed the pure sweet brow of her little kinswoman,
and with a reverence to the priest, she committed her
to the care of Lucia, and, followed by the band of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
vestals, chanting low as they went, she slowly left the
temple.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hyacintha&#8217;s new life was hardly what she had
pictured it would be; what seemed so solemn and
grave a responsibility to her, was an everyday routine
to many of her companions.</p>

<p>The appointed tasks were done, and the appointed
work fulfilled, and then Hyacintha was free to wander
about in the gardens, which sloped up the Cælian
Hill, and where the pure cold water of the spring
was drawn of which Hyacintha had drunk a refreshing
draught on the first evening of her arrival.</p>

<p>Lucia had committed the little Hyacintha to the
especial care of a Roman maiden, who had nearly
passed her time of probation, and would soon be
allowed to take charge of the sacred fire in the stillness
of the night.</p>

<p>When this vestal, who was named Chloe, went
abroad with her lictors in attendance, Hyacintha often
accompanied her; and when the autumn and winter
was passed, and the glory of the Roman spring broke
over the Campagna, strewn broadcast with the flowers
of every hue, Hyacintha&#8217;s spirits seemed to rise to
meet it, and the child&#8217;s heart within her beat with a
gladness which it had not known since she left her
northern home a year before.</p>

<p>Cl&#339;lia had paid her several visits; and once or
twice, under the charge of an older vestal, she had
seen her brother.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>Casca was still living in Cl&#339;lia&#8217;s house, awaiting
more definite orders from his father, which had not
yet arrived. For though the posting service of the
Romans was wonderfully arranged and carried out,
whole months must elapse before the perils and losses
of his children could reach the ear of Severus. It
would, indeed, be a downfall to his pride to know that
both his son and daughter had reached Rome robbed
of all the possessions which had been provided for
them, as meet for the children of a man holding high
office in the Roman city of Verulam.</p>

<p>Casca was well content. He attended the schools,
and listened with the most profound interest to the
orations delivered daily from the Rostra, where the
eloquence of distinguished scholars was in itself an
education.</p>

<p>The military training, on account of his wound,
would not have been possible for Casca under any
circumstances, and he rejoiced with all his heart to be
spared the discipline.</p>

<p>The boy&#8217;s gentleness and goodness won more and
more upon Cl&#339;lia&#8217;s heart, and while Casca wrote upon
parchment wise sayings, which he gathered from the
teaching of the philosophers and poets, Cl&#339;lia would,
when the boy paused for a few minutes to rest his
hand, tell him stories of old Roman valour and adventure,
which was a delight to her to recount and to
Casca to hear.</p>

<p>Never had a winter passed so rapidly for Casca;
and when, with lengthening days, the outdoor life of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the city began again, neither Cl&#339;lia nor Casca was
altogether pleased to think that their long evenings
in the little atrium of the Villa Caius were over.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who can foresee what another winter may bring,&#8221;
Cl&#339;lia said. &#8220;The noble Severus will surely send
orders for your future, and if he decrees it, you must
leave my humble roof. I know not when I shall see
Caius again; he is never at rest on shore, and must
ever be fighting pirate or storm. The gods have
preserved him hitherto&mdash;it may be that they will not
forsake him while I, his mother, live. And for the
rest, sons are made for something better than to sit
with folded hands by their mother&#8217;s side. That, at
least, is not the place of a true Roman.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a sunny morning, early in March, when
Casca set forth for the school with a bundle of papers
and vellum rolls, fastened together and hung across
his shoulder.</p>

<p>He yet wore the short toga prætexta which reached
below the knee, and the golden bulla, which was a
hollow ball of gold, hung round his neck.</p>

<p>Casca had easily obtained admission to the school,
which was presided over by a master who had no fear
that the son of Severus would fail to recompense
him for his trouble. And, indeed, there was something
very winning in the gentle boy. His nervous
temperament and dislike of all scenes of bloodshed
and warfare had irritated his warlike father, but they
were qualities which endeared him to the scholar and
the poet, and Casca had become a great favourite in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the schools, and was remarkable for his ability and
quickness in learning.</p>

<p>It was now many months since the martyrdom of
Alban, and Casca began to think of that dreadful
scene which his father compelled him to witness as a
hideous dream. The persecutions of the Christians
still raged, but in Rome there was so much space and
so wide an area that the boy had not necessarily been
brought in contact with the scenes which were continually
enacted in the Coliseum.</p>

<p>To-day there was a chariot race in the Circus
Maximus, and when the morning school was over one
of Casca&#8217;s companions invited him to stroll with him
in that direction, in the hope of getting near the race.
The Circus Maximus was of such enormous extent
that this was no easy matter.</p>

<p>The arena had in the centre a group of columns
and obelisks on a raised platform, and round this the
chariots raced. The judges sat here, and those to
whom the chariots and horses belonged, moved round
and round, shouting and waving their hands, and encouraging
those who were in the arena to urge on
their fiery horses to the utmost speed.</p>

<p>The spring sunshine illuminated the temple and
buildings on either side of the arena. The tiers of
seats were filled with a vast multitude all in holiday
attire, while the Emperor and his suite occupied a
vantage-ground above the rows of seats on the right
hand of the arena.</p>

<p>These seats were reached by long flights of steps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
which divided the long line into twelve compartments,
and the two boys found some vacant places near the
end and commanding a view of the whole arena,
though perhaps a distant one.</p>

<p>It is difficult to picture anything more beautiful
than the aspect of the Circus Maximus on a day like
this. The range of mountains which seemed to shut
it in at the further end, were seen in distinct outline
against the clear blue sky&mdash;the clear and beautiful
sapphire blue of Italy, which is never seen in our
northern climates.</p>

<p>The dark line of the foliage of spiral cypresses and
round-topped pines set off the snowy whiteness of the
marble pillars to which they made a background, and
Casca was more fascinated by the grandeur of the
place itself than interested in watching the race.</p>

<p>Something in the boy&#8217;s heart seemed to respond
to the beauty around him; and while his friend Fulvius
was excited to frenzy at the hairbreadth success which
one of the chariots won, Casca was lost in his own
meditations, from which he was awoke by the over-turning
of one of the unsuccessful carriages, and the
cry of pain, which sounded through the first shout of
victory.</p>

<p>&#8220;The charioteer was killed!&#8221; he heard a voice
near him say, &#8220;and the horses will never be worth a
silver coin again. So much the worse for Cassianus,
who owns them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fallen horses and the dead charioteer were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
hastily removed, and then another race was proclaimed
by the herald. And again there was breathless anxiety
as to the result.</p>

<p>Casca turned presently at the sound of a voice,
which seemed familiar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not push him roughly; he will make way!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A cursed dog of a Jew!&#8221; was the answer, &#8220;standing,
forsooth, in the way of a noble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Turn him out!&#8221; and then two lictors, who were
stationed at the entrance of every one of the galleries,
seized the old man roughly by the shoulder, and
pushed him before them to the outside of the Circus.</p>

<p>Casca forgot the race and the shouts which proclaimed
another victory, forgot Fulvius, and that he
had agreed to remain with him and return to supper
with him, and followed the old man, who was leaning
on the arm of a woman whose voice had been
familiar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not push him roughly,&#8221; the voice now said.
It was the voice of Ebba, the slave of his mother
Cæcilia.</p>

<p>Casca followed the pair at a little distance, till he
was beyond the shouts of the crowd which was thronging
the entrances to the Circus.</p>

<p>Then he laid his hand on Ebba&#8217;s arm. She started,
and turned round&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it possible!&#8221; she exclaimed; &#8220;but do not speak
to me, dear master.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Speak! yes, I must speak, and learn whence you
came, and who has brought you hither.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>&#8220;Nay, not here, not here; it is dangerous for you
and me here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, my daughter,&#8221; moaned old Ezra, &#8220;come
on, nor delay, for this is no place for us. Young man,
what is your business?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will come, father,&#8221; said Anna, &#8220;I will come. I
would you had heeded me, and never come near the
race.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, but I furnished the harness&mdash;the gold&mdash;for
the chariot of Cassianus, and now&#8221;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, I pray you, father,&#8221; Anna whispered. &#8220;We
are watched.&#8221; Then turning to Casca, she said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow, at dawn, near the fountain of Egeria,
that is near to the temple of Vesta, to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then Anna hurried on, and Casca was accosted
by a man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know the woman and the old man?&#8221;</p>

<p>Casca shook his head. &#8220;The old man is a stranger
to me, but <i>not</i> the woman,&#8221; was the rejoinder.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would have you beware, Casca, the son of
Severus: that woman is one of the Christians, though
she lives with an old Jew, a dealer in precious stones
and pearls, a charlatan and sorcerer. Beware!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know not,&#8221; said Casca, with some dignity, &#8220;why
you should issue these commands against me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have the best reason. I have to-day, by the
special messenger from Verulam, received commands
from your father, the noble Severus, that you are to
be committed to my care till you come to man&#8217;s estate.
I went to seek you at the house of Cl&#339;lia Pudentia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and she bade me seek you at the schools, and thence
again I was sent to the Circus Maximus. Return with
me and watch the race out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay!&#8221; Casca said, &#8220;I have had quite enough of
the race.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will prefer the Coliseum to-morrow,&#8221; the man
said, with a malignant smile. &#8220;There is fine sport
coming on there, to which I bid you. But you must
see my credentials for thus accosting you. If you will
not return to the Circus, accompany me to my house
at the foot of the Quirinal Hill, and I will lay before
you your father&#8217;s letter. Surely you have heard my
name&mdash;Antonius Scæva&mdash;I hold a high office in the
Emperor&#8217;s household. I am as well known as the
Palatine,&#8221; he said, with a cynical smile.</p>

<p>Casca accompanied his new companion rather reluctantly,
and listened to his somewhat bombastic talk
with disgust.</p>

<p>He would greatly have preferred remaining with
Cl&#339;lia, in the quiet retirement of her humble home.
He dreaded the return to the life that he had led at
Verulam, and yet the commands of his father, he
knew too well, could not be set aside, and he had no
alternative but to obey.</p>

<p>Antonius&#8217;s house was one of the most magnificent
in the valley below the Quirinal and Esquiline Hills.</p>

<p>Besides the spacious atrium, or large outer court,
there was a third large peristyle, from which immense
apartments opened, furnished in the most magnificent
style. There were carpets from Eastern looms, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
many coloured curtains of purple and gold embroidery,
from Babylon. Curious carving in ivory and metal
were on every side; and Antonius said, as he led
Casca to one of the most magnificent chambers&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there is no great hardship in taking up
your abode with me. The emperor himself is pleased
to frequent this house, and we are ready with a
banquet for him at any moment. A penalty, you may
say, to pay for imperial favour. Now we will take that
couch and throw aside these parchments, and have a
light repast.&#8221;</p>

<p>Antonius clapped his hands, and as if by magic a
retinue of slaves appeared, bearing all kinds of refreshments,
in silver and gold cups and flagons, with
dishes of all the viands then most in favour with the
luxurious Romans, the degenerate representatives of
the noble and hardy race which had laid the foundation
of the great empire, even now hastening to its
fall!</p>

<p>Antonius led the usual life of the Roman nobles
of that time. He lounged, drank, and played for high
stakes at the gaming-tables at the baths. He sauntered
into the Forum, and listened to some favourite
orator, or later in the day he attended the Court, and
either drove in his gaily-decorated chariot, or sauntered
in the gardens where the beauty and fashion of
Rome resorted. Then he would bid guests to his supper,
who were never unwilling to respond to his invitation,
for his board was always spread with sumptuous
fare, and the emperor himself was frequently announced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
by heralds as deigning to confer the favour
of his presence upon Antonius.</p>

<p>When Antonius had dismissed the slaves and attendants,
he said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is your father&#8217;s letter. He begs me to make
a Roman of you, and mentions that by reason of
robbers by land, and pirates by sea, you had arrived
in a sorry plight. You can be equipped by my people
in native attire, and it is time that you left off that
prætexta, if your father&#8217;s version of your age be true&mdash;near
fifteen. He says, and truly, that you are small
and slender, and a contrast to him in all things. He
does not think you will make a soldier.&#8221;</p>

<p>Antonius laughed. &#8220;And I agree with him; we
must turn you into a Roman, befitting in manners and
appearance your high rank. You have a sister a
vestal, I hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a young sister received as a disciple,&#8221;
Casca said.</p>

<p>&#8220;A vestal&#8217;s brother must needs be careful to do
her honour, and you must submit yourself to the hands
of my dresser, and acquire some accomplishment, play
on some instrument, as well as play high at other
games. The Emperor may look kindly on you, and I
will get you a place in his household.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Antonius yawned, and lazily stretching himself
on his luxurious couch, leaned over a few parchments
and made a cabalistic sign on one or two, and
then settled himself to his siesta.</p>

<p>Meantime Casca was reading his father&#8217;s letter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
which Antonius had tossed to him, and there was
also a short one addressed to himself. He knew
already the contents of that written to Antonius, but
Severus&#8217;s counsel to his young son may bear to be
transcribed here as a specimen of paternal counsel in
those days of Roman decline.</p>

<p>&#8220;Severus, pro-consul at Verulam, to my son Casca,
greeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;My son,&mdash;News has reached me of your disasters
by sea and land on your journey towards Rome. This
will reach you by the hand of the noble Antonius,
who will by his goodness receive you into his household,
to prepare you to take office in that of the Emperor
himself. You refused the study of arms, to my
great disquiet, therefore you must now study diligently
to shape your manners after those of the young nobles
at Rome. You must learn to sing, game, and become
an adept on some instrument of music. You must
study dress and deportment, and lie as occasion
requires, when the flattery of your superiors demand
it. My office in this distant province, amidst these
barbarous tribes, has obliged me to live the life of the
soldier only. You refused that life, therefore you
must cultivate that of the courtier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have no more intercourse with the woman at
whose house you lodged. I have directed that gold
should be given her. Her son Caius did his part
well, but, alas for Burrhus and his maniple! they are
prisoners and slaves, and we doubt if a ransom would
avail if offered. We must leave them to the gods.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>&#8220;I have received news also from my noble kinswoman
Terentia Rufilla, that my daughter finds favour
in her eyes, and that her beauty and wisdom are far
beyond her years.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her mother and yours sends greeting. Beware
of the vile reptiles calling themselves Christians; it is
told me that they swarm in Rome like ants. Here in
Verulam we have done good work amongst them, and
thanks are due to Valens and Claudius, who crushed
out a goodly number in the forest beyond Radburn.
The chief Amphibalus was done to death by stoning,
and when the cell was opened on the morning after
his execution, to our great astonishment the woman
Agatha and the miserable slave Ebba were found
dead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Claudius lighted a pyre at once and the bodies
were burned to ashes, before we knew we were saved
the trouble of roasting them alive. We had been
counselled to try burning, as execution by the sword,
and even stoning, bore small fruit. Again, I say, beware
of the Christians as of lepers and the plague.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vale!&#8221;</p>

<p>Neither of these letters was in the hand of Severus,
who could wield the sword and battle-axe, but hardly
a pen. They were written on the parchment roll in a
clear hand by the man who fulfilled an office which
we should call that of secretary to the Governor&#8217;s
court.</p>

<p>As Casca read this letter, his face betrayed surprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and emotion, which Antonius, lying back with half-closed
eyes, was not slow to discern.</p>

<p>&#8220;I crave leave,&#8221; Casca said, &#8220;to return whence I
came till the morrow. I have books and parchments
which I must have carried hither, and I must see
good Cl&#339;lia, the mother of Caius, and take leave of
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, be it so,&#8221; was Antonius&#8217;s reply, in a lazy
tone. &#8220;Meet me in the Coliseum to-morrow, when
there will be some sport with thy father&#8217;s enemies, the
Christians. By Jove!&#8221; Antonius said, &#8220;I care not
whether they live or die, though we should miss some
sport if there were no more to be thrown to the
beasts. Vale! Vale!&#8221; he exclaimed, waving his hand,
and leaving Casca free to depart.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small>DAYSPRING.</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Cl&#339;lia</span> received the news of Casca&#8217;s immediate
departure with that self-repression which at the time
of greatest trial characterised the old Roman matron.</p>

<p>The inevitable was accepted, and she merely said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was but likely that your noble father should
desire to place you amongst the nobles, but you depart
to scenes of license, I fear, and to see the hunt
after pleasure put before honour and the welfare of
Rome. It was not always thus. There were times
when the sons of our great city strove after all those
gifts which should make them her worthy protectors
and defenders. They call Rome now the mistress of
the world, but her children have grown weak since
the arms of their great mother have embraced so many
strangers and aliens. I would, my son Casca, that
you were to be committed to one even of less exalted
rank than Antonius, who, if report speaks truly, lives
the life of luxury and ease which is as a canker-worm
at the root of the gourd.&#8221;</p>

<p>Casca&#8217;s tender, gentle spirit was touched at the
emotion which Cl&#339;lia could not entirely hide under
her quiet calm manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would that I could stay with you, dear Cl&#339;lia,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
said the boy. &#8220;I am not fitted for the life to which
I go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no choice for us; a son must obey his
father; and it may be that in some time of need the
mother of Caius may stand you in good stead, as
once the son did, when he rescued you and your
sister from the pursuing sea-robbers and brought you
safe into port. If the time ever comes when you need
Cl&#339;lia, she will not fail you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cl&#339;lia embraced Casca affectionately as she spoke,
and then she bestirred herself to prepare the evening
meal, which they were to eat together for the last
time.</p>

<p>Casca thought it wisest to keep the appointment
with Ebba to himself. He intended to leave the
house long before dawn, and to return to make final
arrangements for his departure later in the day. The
strange announcement in his father&#8217;s letter of the
death of both Agatha and Ebba seemed a mystery
he could not unravel. He knew nothing of Agatha,
nor could he believe that it was Ebba who was with
her in a cell at Radburn, and that both women should
be found dead when the prison door was opened.</p>

<p>Certain it was, however, that he had seen Ebba at
the Circus&mdash;he felt sure he could not be mistaken.
She knew him, and addressed him as &#8220;Master,&#8221; and
he wanted no further proof.</p>

<p>How she came to Rome, and why she was with
the old Jew, he could not understand, and he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
anxious for the meeting at the fountain of Egeria,
below the Cælian Hill.</p>

<p>It was quite dark when Casca left Cl&#339;lia&#8217;s house
the next morning, except, indeed, for the light of the
stars, which had not yet begun to fade before the
dawn.</p>

<p>When the boy reached the deserted and silent
Forum, faint streaks of the coming day were just
enough to show the outline of the columns which
supported the façade of the temples, and the statues
which surrounded the pillars.</p>

<p>There were a good many sleepers about the steps
of the temple and plinths of the statues. The outside
garment or toga was rolled up for a pillow, and the
poor Roman citizens, who lived, for the most part,
desultory lives out of doors, and earned a scanty
pittance by helping to unlade the mules which came
in from the country to supply fruit and milk and
vegetables to the city, never desired easier or more
luxurious couches! Then Casca threaded his way
cautiously along till he took the narrow path which
wound by the temple of Vesta to the Cælian Hill. In
the hush before the dawn every sound was distinctly
heard&mdash;the ripple of running waters&mdash;the low splash of
fountains&mdash;the fall of solitary footsteps. Once there
was the sound of a band of revellers, who were returning
to one of the palaces in the Palatine, after a night
of wild bacchanalian license. The noise grew nearer,
passed below the place where Casca stood, and then
grew fainter and fainter, and died away in the distance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Then there was a low sullen roar, which was
often heard in the stillness of a Roman night&mdash;the
lions roaring at daybreak for their prey, the food
which would be supplied to them in the arena before
sunset, when the Christians who might have been in
captivity in some of the adjoining cells would be
brought out to die!</p>

<p>Casca pursued his way, leaving the temple of
Vesta behind him, pausing every now and then to
look back at the place where his little sister was one
day to minister, to keep the sacred fire burning, for
the safety and welfare of the Roman people all over
the world.</p>

<p>The boy&#8217;s heart went out in loving tenderness
towards Hyacintha, and he longed for one hour of
free intercourse, such as they used to have in the villa
of Severus, in Verulam.</p>

<p>The footpath between the gardens was very narrow,
and wound in and out, till the summit of the Cælian
Hill was reached. Here Casca paused again, and was
soon conscious that a figure clothed in a long dark
stole and hood was seated on a fragment of stone
waiting for him. It was, indeed, Ebba, the Christian
Anna, who advanced to him, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear master, the son of my lord the noble
Severus, I greet you with humble affection. I have
been yearning to see you, for I knew that you were in
Rome, and I have watched and waited, and now you
are here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Ebba,&#8221; exclaimed Casca, &#8220;I am right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
glad to find you here. But tell me how it has come
about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was delivered from death by Claudius, your
noble-hearted friend, who bade me see my dear young
mistress, and tell her that he had fulfilled his vow.
But I have never dared to present myself at the
temple, or the house of the vestals, for I might perchance
bring trouble upon my dear young mistress,
for I am a baptised Christian.&#8221;</p>

<p>Casca started back&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;A Christian!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;There is greater
peril here than in Verulam. There is a fresh outbreak
of persecution, and a number are to be thrown
to the beasts this very day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; Anna said, in a firm voice. &#8220;The life
that my Lord has given back to me I will guard, nor
rashly deliver myself up. But, oh! my young master,
why will you not accept the cross and bear it after
Jesus?</p>

<p>&#8220;He is rising over the world,&#8221; Anna continued,
&#8220;like yonder light, which proclaims the near approach
of the sun. He is coming to flood this sinful world
with righteousness, even as the golden flood of sunrise
is bathing the Alban Hills.&#8221; As she spoke, she pointed
with her hand to the scene stretched out before them,
as they stood under the shadow of the ilex trees, and
looked down upon the prospect, which lay like a
vision of beauty, rather than a reality of this lower
world, in all its loveliness. For one by one the
peaks of the Alban Hills rose from the plain, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
rosy flush touched the highest of all, where the old
temple of Jupiter once stood, the common meeting-place
and shrine of the early Latin race. Soon the
Campagna smiled in the early level rays of the sun,
and everything became imbued with life!</p>

<p>Casca was strangely moved as Anna said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, or at Verulam in the caves, or in the forests
of Britain, the Lord is the light. Oh! my noble
Casca, I pray you bathe your soul in His light, and
you will have peace and joy in His presence!&#8221;</p>

<p>Casca folded his arms and looked out upon the
shining landscape, wondering much that the slave-girl
should have become a woman on whose face was
written a high and noble resolve, the outcome of the
reality and fervour of her faith.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; she continued, &#8220;I am now living in the
Jews&#8217; quarter, on the slope of the hill. I hear from
them the words of their prophets and sibyls, and I
know that these foretold the coming of the Saviour of
the world. They did not know Him, and he was
nailed to the cross, like a malefactor, by the Roman
Governor&#8217;s order, in the province of Judæa. The Jews
clamoured for His life, as the Romans clamour for the
lives of the Christians. And He laid it down, to take it
again, dying for Roman and Greek, Jew and Christian,
Briton and Druid, alike.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would I could believe,&#8221; Casca sighed, &#8220;for
there is a hunger of the soul nothing can satisfy. But,
Anna, this may be a fable or a phantom, this Christ
of whom you speak.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>&#8220;Nay, dear master, He is no fable and no phantom.
He lives in <i>us</i> and we live in Him. But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She broke off suddenly, for two figures clothed in
the purest white garments were seen ascending the
hill with light, agile steps. The taller of the two bore
a pitcher on her head, with the grace with which only
the women of Italy know how to carry a burden. Her
young companion had no burden. She had gathered
a large bunch of the pale violet anemone which carpets
the turf in every Roman garden in spring, and had
fastened it under the fillet with which her short shining
curls were bound.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two vestals!&#8221; Casca said, springing to his feet.
&#8220;The younger one is&mdash;yes, surely it is&mdash;Hyacintha!&#8221;</p>

<p>In another moment the brother and sister stood
face to face. Hyacintha gave him a rapturous greeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chloe!&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;this is my brother
Casca.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chloe, who had set down her pitcher, smiled pleasantly.
And then, with a wild cry of joy, Hyacintha
discovered that Anna, her Ebba of other times, was
with her brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have come to draw the water from the
spring,&#8221; she exclaimed; &#8220;little did I think I should
find you here. Oh, Ebba, tell me how you came
hither!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been longing to see you, dear mistress, to
give you a message. My story is indeed so strange,
that even to myself it is scarce like reality.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>&#8220;Tell it to me, tell it to me! Oh, Chloe, may I
stay, and hear what she says? She was the dear attendant
of my mother and myself, in my old home at
Verulam. She has brought me a message.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can remain here while I go to the fountain,&#8221;
said Chloe. She was good-natured and kindly, and
the little Hyacintha had been her especial care and
joy since the day of her arrival in the house of the
vestals, now six months before.</p>

<p>Indeed, Hyacintha had won all hearts. There was
a gentle grace about her, and yet a sunny brightness,
which made the vestals call her their singing bird.</p>

<p>The deep earnestness of her nature, and her serious
desire to fit herself for the high office of a vestal,
did not prevent her from entering into every innocent
pleasure with the keenest delight.</p>

<p>The anxiety which had awoke in her young heart
at Verulam, to find a more excellent way of life than
that led by the ladies she saw in her mother&#8217;s society,
had been a weight upon her child-heart. But now she
had found, as she believed, her vocation; and while
leaving far behind her, her young companions in the
accomplishments in which they were all instructed, she
was always simple and humble, and her exceeding
beauty, which was increasing month by month, did not
make her vain.</p>

<p>&#8220;A great gift to lay at the shrine of the goddess,&#8221;
Terentia had told her, and Hyacintha joyfully laid
down that gift, and would gladly lay down others also,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
for the honour of the goddess who had the sacred fire
in her keeping.</p>

<p>Ebba could scarcely restrain her expressions of
admiration as Hyacintha seated herself on a stone
bench beneath an outspread ilex tree, and said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Ebba, my message, my message! Dear Ebba,
you look so happy now, no longer like a sad slave,
but free and happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dearest lady, I am free&mdash;free from the fetters
which bound me, no longer a slave, but a <i>child</i> of
a loving Father.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hyacintha&#8217;s questioning eyes were turned wistfully
upon Anna as she spoke. She could hardly understand
her.</p>

<p>The sunlight flickered through the branches upon
Hyacintha&#8217;s spotless robe, and touched the ruddy gold
of her hair with glory.</p>

<p>Her little sandalled feet peeped out beneath the
hem of her robe, as they rested on the mossy turf.
Her beautifully-formed hands were folded in a sort of
happy expectation as to what Anna might say next,
what the message might be from her home beyond the
stormy sea, and her whole attitude was one of attention
and wonder as to what was coming.</p>

<p>Casca watched his sister with eyes of tender
brotherly admiration, and he wondered it had never
struck him before, how beautiful she was!</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Ebba,&#8221; Hyacintha said, &#8220;the child of a loving
Father! I do not understand. I know you left our
home, in Britain, after they had killed the man on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
hill-side, near Verulam. I know my father was angry
at your loss, put a price on your head, but I know no
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor need I tell you all that happened, for it
would serve no good end, nor would I throw over
your brightness so dark a cloud as the story of my
life since we met would surely throw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was baptised by the holy Amphibalus on the
night of my escape. Then our little band wandered
towards the fastnesses of Wales, after hiding in a cave
at Radburn. We were settling in a village, in peace
and rest, converts daily brought in by the teaching of
Amphibalus, when we were surprised by the barbarians,
and to escape them a band of thirty fell into
the hands of a Roman convoy under Valens and Claudius.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Claudius! good, dear Claudius!&#8221; Hyacintha exclaimed;
&#8220;nay, I do not believe he hunted you
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He did as he was commanded, and many fell.
Some were carried to Radburn as prisoners. I was
one, and Agatha, the mother&#8217;s sister of Heraclius, who
perished before the holy Alban rather than take his
life,&mdash;Agatha was my support and stay. We were
thrown into a dungeon together, from which we were
dragged to witness the martyrdom of Amphibalus.</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember little more after that, till I found myself
committed to the care of old Ezra, the Jew, by
brave Claudius, who rescued me from death, and bade
me say to you, dear Hyacintha, that he had fulfilled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
his vow made to the gods and to you, and had saved
the life of the slave whom you loved.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whom I must love always,&#8221; Hyacintha murmured.
&#8220;But how was it done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have since heard from Ezra that his daughter
died on her toilsome journey from Verulam to Radburn,
and that Claudius, finding him weeping over
her body, took it up and carried it to the dungeon,
where he left it with Agatha, and carried me away.
I have never heard what befel Agatha&mdash;my friend
and mother&mdash;for a mother in Christ she was, truly,
to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Severus&#8217;s letter to his son became intelligible now.
The boy sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can tell you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Both women, so my
father writes in his letter&mdash;both women were found
dead in their cell, and their bodies were burned to
ashes the next morning. My father believes that you,
Ebba, were one of those women.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anna raised her eyes to the sky above her, and
the tears which gathered there flowed down her
cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is with Him whom she loved, in Paradise,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;only, would that our Father had taken me
with her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Ebba, do not grieve,&#8221; Hyacintha said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; Casca sighed out, &#8220;nay, it is over for her,
it is to come for you and for me. Tell me where I
can get instruction in the faith of which you speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come to the Via Appia in the early morning, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
in the late evening. I will be on the watch, for I
steal thither unperceived, as hundreds of our faith
steal. In the last sleeping-place of the Christians the
faith of the living is built up, and you shall be instructed
in that faith. Think you, Casca, that there is
no Rome but that which you see? Yes, there is a
Rome, invisible to all mortal eyes, over which the
angels watch the Christian people of the great city,
who are compelled to worship their Lord in secret and
silence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will come,&#8221; Casca said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go whither, dear brother?&#8221; asked Hyacintha;
&#8220;nay, run into no danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>Casca smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am never bold or daring, little sister; has not
that weakness of mine been ever foremost? Did not
good Claudius try to harden me to danger? Did not
my father look on me with scorn, as unworthy of his
noble ancestors? I will run into no danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chloe&#8217;s footsteps were heard approaching, on her
return from the fountain, where she had filled the
pitcher with pure crystal water.</p>

<p>This water was used to sprinkle the altar of
Vesta, and only those who were fully qualified by
their term of probation were ever allowed to perform
this office.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Hyacintha,&#8221; Chloe said, &#8220;the day wears on
apace, and we must return to the temple.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hyacintha embraced her brother, and then turned
to follow Chloe. The path bore a little to the left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
before it descended to the gate of the garden, and
there Hyacintha paused for a moment, and with her
hand waved her farewell to the two who stood below
her. The low level rays of the lately-risen sun
glanced through the vines and olive trees amongst
which she stood. Her white robe glistened and
glowed in the sunshine, and her face&mdash;that beautiful
face&mdash;so childlike, and yet so womanly, made Anna
exclaim&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is like the Hyacintha of my dream in the
dungeon! Oh, that the journey was indeed over, and
that she was standing to welcome me at the golden
gate! but it will come at last&mdash;at last.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hyacintha had disappeared at the garden gate.
A lictor stood to escort the two vestals along the
public thoroughfare to the door of the vestals&#8217; house.
The vestals were never allowed to appear in public
without a guard; for from their high office they formed
a part of the sacred magistracy and state of the city
of Rome.</p>

<p>When Casca and Anna were left alone together,
Anna said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must not be seen together in the public streets;
therefore, dear young master, I will depart first, and
you can follow. The quarter where the Jews live is
below the hill, and I reach it by a side path.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you happy with that old man, Ebba? Is he
good to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, at times,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;He mourns for
his lost Rachel and his lost treasure. The name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Christian is scarcely less hated by the Jews than by
the heathen, and I live a secluded life with Ezra.
But he has taught me much of the words of the old
prophets and sibyls in whom he believes, who worshipped
the God of Israel, and I have learned to sing
some of the songs written by one of their kings to the
praise of Jehovah. And now we part till the evening,
when I will conduct you to the place where you shall
hear much which my poor tongue cannot tell. But
be wary, for the eyes of many are upon all who are
suspected of being Christians.&#8221;</p>

<p>In another moment Anna had glided away, and
Casca was left alone.</p>

<p>A new life was beginning for the boy that day;
he was to exchange the toga prætexta for the toga
virilis&mdash;the boy&#8217;s garment for the man&#8217;s&mdash;a sign of
manhood which the Romans looked upon as imperative.</p>

<p>Before that bright day had closed, Casca had
bidden Cl&#339;lia farewell, and, with a heavy heart, had
committed his books and parchments to two slaves
from Antonius&#8217;s household, who had arrived for them
about noon.</p>

<p>Then he penned a dutiful epistle to his father,
which would be despatched by the next special
messenger who might be sent on official business
from Rome to her distant province of Britain, and
prepared himself for his fresh start in the palace of
Antonius.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>It is very hard for us to realise the events of the
fourth century, and any picture of those times, and of
the men and women who took part in the scenes then
enacted, must, at the best, be shadowy. To the eye
of the casual observer, Rome, seated on her seven
hills, under the sway of the Emperor Diocletian, was
at the zenith of fame and prosperity.</p>

<p>The throngs in the Forum&mdash;the gay crowds in the
gardens of Circus Maximus, the race-course, the arena&mdash;all
told of wealth and prosperity and pleasure. But
this very love of show and outward grandeur, this
excessive devotion to the indulgence of every selfish
desire, was sapping the foundation of the great empire,
and its decline had even then set in.</p>

<p>Still, out of sight, and hidden from general observation,
a kingdom was growing daily in strength and
numbers. Like the grain of mustard seed, like the
little lump of leaven, the Church of the Catacombs
was gathering force and extending its boundary,
month by month, year by year. But if it requires a
strong effort of the imagination to call back the individual
life of the men and women who flocked to
the resorts of pleasure and business in the Forum and
the Circus, it is almost more difficult to realise the
buried life of Rome at that time, which, nevertheless,
was as a spark to be kindled into a light that should
cast its bright beams over the world, when the splendour
of the great Empire, with all its false brilliancy,
should have sunk in gloom and darkness.</p>

<p>The Christians grew and multiplied, and we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
told that thousands were even now converts in heart,
though held back by fear from confessing Christ
openly.</p>

<p>The persecution which was raging fiercely in 304
had, perhaps, the effect of driving timid ones into
obscurity, but it was as a stimulant to many steadfast
souls, who died with a smile of victory on their faces
and a song of rejoicing on their lips.</p>

<p>Anna, the British slave, lived in the Jews&#8217; quarter,
with old Ezra, and faithfully fulfilled her duties as
his daughter. The old man was querulous and exacting;
the desire of gain, which had taken him to the
distant pearl-fisheries of Britain, was strong upon him.
He found Anna&#8217;s skill with her fingers most useful to
him, and she was now engaged in the embroidery of
a quantity of rich velvet with gold and seed-pearls,
which Ezra was to sell to a dealer, for the train
of the Empress, and for which he was to receive a
fabulous sum. But it was the gold, and not the advantages
which the gold could bring, which was precious
to Ezra. The Jews&#8217; quarter, hidden under a
spur of the Cælian Hill, was thickly populated, and
the low square buildings where they dwelt were poor
and overcrowded. They had one rather larger than
the rest, which was set apart for their synagogue, and
here the more devout worshipped the God of their
fathers at the appointed seasons.</p>

<p>The community was not a happy or particularly
harmonious one; jealousies were rife, and Ezra was
believed to have amassed riches, though he lived in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
a mean way, and professed to be poor. One of the
Jewish women would often come and sit with Anna,
while she bent over her embroidery, and she would
talk of the expected deliverer of Israel, who was soon
to come, &#8220;As a king, to reign,&#8221; she would say. And
then Anna would tell of the King who <i>had</i> come&mdash;whose
dominion was to spread from sea to sea, and
who was to put all enemies under His feet.</p>

<p>Anna had been well taught by Amphibalus and
Agatha, and instructed in the Scriptures, so that she
could tell Rebekah many things of which she had
never heard.</p>

<p>As the spring day waned to its close, Anna&#8217;s eyes
ached with the continuous work, till pearls and gold
thread looked one confused mass; she laid aside her
frame, and invited Rebekah to accompany her to the
Cæmeteria, as soon as the shadows fell upon the
city, and they might pass unnoticed. Rebekah hesitated
a little, but finally agreed to bear Anna company,
stipulating that she might return if she heard
anything spoken against the God of Jacob in the
place where Anna said she would be instructed in her
faith.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, you can hear no word against the God of
Jacob, for He is our God for ever and ever,&#8221; Anna
answered. &#8220;You will hear of his Son the Deliverer,
whom your people, knowing not what they did, nailed
to the cross.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rebekah shook her head. &#8220;Our Jehovah would
never suffer Messiah to perish like a malefactor, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
contrary to His nature. He is the Lord God merciful
and gracious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; Anna quietly added, &#8220;He will in no wise
spare the guilty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have sacrifices offered for sins once a year,&#8221;
was the reply, with a proud sense of security.</p>

<p>&#8220;But this one sacrifice of Christ, once offered,
avails for all time and for all people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; the young Jewess said, &#8220;I will accompany
you, for it is at least a diversion. I am weary of
pining for my espoused husband Joel. He has departed
hence and I have had no tidings of him for two years,
and I can scarce bear my life shut up in this dull
corner of Rome, while I know in Jerusalem I should
have a high place in all the feasts and joyful meetings
of my own people. It was a woeful day for me when
my father Ezekiel came hither.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rebekah was a fine Jewish woman, with the strongly-marked
features and raven hair of her race, but her
face was hard, and the expression of her mouth cross
and discontented.</p>

<p>&#8220;I loathe this place,&#8221; she repeated, &#8220;and I marvel
how any one like you can abide here. You are bound
by no tie to old Ezra.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a strong tie,&#8221; Anna said; &#8220;by the death of
his daughter my life was saved. I must be as a daughter
to him while I live.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I would not count such a man as a father,&#8221;
was Rebekah&#8217;s reply. &#8220;When shall we start? the sun
has nearly set.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>&#8220;As soon as you please,&#8221; Anna replied; &#8220;I must
get ready my long cloak, and cover my head, and set
out the evening meal, and light the lamp in the outer
court, that Ezra may find all ready, and think I am
gone to rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then do not tarry,&#8221; Rebekah said, &#8220;for I am
cramped with sitting on the low cushion, and long for
air and sights and sounds pleasanter than those which
greet me here. Hark! there&#8217;s the sound of a multitude
shouting, there must be sport in the arena; food for
the lions, no doubt.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X.<br />

<small>SUNSET.</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sun which had been shining with cloudless
brilliancy throughout the day shed the rich glow of
its level beams across the Via Sacra or Appian way.
In the clear transparent atmosphere, every monument
and every stately statue stood out sharply defined
against the sky&mdash;a sky of clearest azure, except at
the horizon, where lines of violet and rose-coloured
clouds, tinged with gold, floated in saffron depths,
which were shaded into flaming orange below them,
and to the tenderest daffodil as it mingled in opal
transparency with the blue canopy above.</p>

<p>The grandeur of a Roman sunset must be seen,
and cannot be described&mdash;no pen or brush can paint
it; and as Anna gazed at the glorious pageantry
before her, her lips moved as she repeated in a low
voice&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The street of the city is gold, as it were transparent
glass. Surely the gates of heaven&mdash;the heaven
of the Christian&#8217;s hope&mdash;might well be there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her companion Rebekah was not thinking of the
sky, nor of the grandeur of that road between the
tombs along which they passed.</p>

<p>A few horsemen in rich and splendid accoutrements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
were riding slowly along, and on the broad
footway several groups of people were walking, and
she was far more interested in them.</p>

<p>Presently a cry was heard that the Christians were
coming. And then there was a rush of many feet,
and two women bound with cords were seen hurried
along towards the spot where Anna and her Jewish
companion stood.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have been captured near the Cæmeterium,&#8221;
a voice said.</p>

<p>And then there was a sudden hush and pause;
the oncoming crowd stood still, as all eyes were turned
in the opposite direction, and a voice cried&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Vestal Maxima!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are saved then,&#8221; exclaimed Rebekah; &#8220;all
prisoners on their way to execution have a free pardon
if they are met by a vestal. And this is the Vestal
Maxima.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anna looked earnestly, as if she could never look
away, at the stately figure of Terentia Rufilla and the
young disciple at her side, Hyacintha Severa, as she
was called.</p>

<p>The vestals who were in attendance were all
dressed in their long stoles of dazzling whiteness, and
they were preceded by a guard of lictors.</p>

<p>The child, Hyacintha, had in her hands a large
quantity of flowers, which had been gathered from
the grounds of one of the spacious palaces where
Terentia Rufilla had been paying a visit.</p>

<p>So high was the esteem in which the priestess of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Vesta was held that the members of the Imperial
family could not receive greater homage. Those who
were guarding the prisoners halted, and knelt, and
Terentia asked, in a clear ringing voice&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are the prisoners, and of what rank?&#8221;</p>

<p>The chief lictor replied that they were peasant
women of no rank or name, and that they were obstinate
followers of the false religion.</p>

<p>Terentia&#8217;s beautiful expressive face showed but
little sign of pity, for the Christians were enemies of
her goddess, and ought to perish, and there was in
the heart of the Vestal Maxima only a sense of duty
and scarcely of satisfaction as she said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is our pleasure that the captives be set free.&#8221;</p>

<p>To the surprise of all around, one of the women
exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;We desire not freedom; we cannot recant; we
believe in Jesus the Lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To the lions with them&mdash;they want sport for the
arena,&#8221; exclaimed a voice. &#8220;If they do not recant,
spare them not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, spare them, spare them!&#8221; exclaimed Hyacintha.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no need for entreaty,&#8221; said Terentia,
haughtily. &#8220;Unloose the cords and let the women
free. It is the invariable favour granted by the
priestesses of the goddess Vesta, nor can I remit it,
though, forsooth, I have rarely seen a favour so coldly
received. Move on,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>And then the crowd separated, and the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
prisoners&#8217; cords being loosed they were flung aside,
with rough blows and angry exclamations. And the
people poured on towards the Coliseum, where they
yet hoped to find the beasts were not disappointed of
their prey.</p>

<p>The two women sank down on the highway, utterly
exhausted. They had been rescued from death, but
had hardly power to realise it. Anna put her arm
round one of the women, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I lead you home?&#8221; and Rebekah, less gently,
had taken her companion by the shoulder and tried
to rouse her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they gone?&#8221; she murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are gone where you will follow unless you
rouse yourselves. Your lives have been spared; make
haste to flee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whither shall we flee?&#8221; said one poor woman.
&#8220;We had come in from the country, footsore and
weary, when we were seized. We were resting on the
steps of the monument of Cæcilia Metella, when we
were asked if we had attended the great sacrifice in
the temple of Jupiter. Nay, we said, for we are
Christians and worship only the Lord Jesus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can take you to comparative safety,&#8221; Anna said,
&#8220;if you will come with me. It will be a refuge for
you; you will be taken care of.&#8221;</p>

<p>One of the women said, &#8220;We are poor peasant
women, who have come into the city to get food.
The Lord seemed to point the way, and we knew
there were good Christians in Rome.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>&#8220;There are good Christians,&#8221; said Anna, &#8220;but persecution
is raging amongst them now. Lean on me
and we will try to find a safe place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I must not leave you,&#8221; Rebekah said,
&#8220;but I would we had not met the poor wretches.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then by slow degrees the poor women passed
along the sacred way amongst the great monuments
of the past glory of Rome, till they turned in at a low
opening in the wall, and a voice said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who enters?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the name of Christ,&#8221; was Anna&#8217;s answer.</p>

<p>Then out of the darkness a tiny spark was seen
burning. It was the light of a lamp hung from the
roof at the distance of some hundred yards.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am here also,&#8221; Casca said, touching Anna&#8217;s
arm. &#8220;I have escaped from the Coliseum, where I
was forced to go with Antonius.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anna made no rejoinder, except to put her hand
upon the boy and lead him on. The two poor peasant
women and Rebekah followed, and the long passage
ended just where the lamp hung. By its dim light
they crossed to another low doorway, and then guided
by another lamp, threaded their way through several
galleries and passages, till they reached an open
space where some fifty people had assembled. This
larger space was pierced through the rock and ground
above with several openings, through which the sky
could be seen. Two lamps hung over the slab of a
tomb of one of the faithful departed, and there the
vessels for the Holy Communion were placed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>A young deacon was speaking when Anna and
her friends came in, leading the poor women by the
hand. The young deacon ceased speaking, and inquired
the names of the new-comers, and their errand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have brought this youth,&#8221; Anna said, &#8220;a Roman
of noble birth, who is anxious to know more of the
Faith. This young woman is a Jewess, and these
peasants,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;have just been rescued
from the jaws of death. They were being dragged
to the arena, when they were met by a procession
of vestal virgins and released.&#8221; Several of the little
assembly rose, and made the new-comers welcome,
getting food and drink for them, in their fainting
condition, from one of the openings behind the tombs.</p>

<p>The Catacombs at Rome are now visited by many&mdash;and
what pictures rise out of the past as the long
subterranean passages become peopled with the early
Christians, who bore thither their dead, laying them
in the tombs cut out of the rock, and encircling them
with all the tender memories of Him whom they believed
to have opened the Kingdom of Heaven to all
believers.</p>

<p>The word Catacomb, is, we are told, modern; but
the Greek word, Cæmeteria, or sleeping place, was the
one dear to the Christians, and always used by them
to express their faith in the words&mdash;&#8220;Them that sleep
in Jesus shall God bring unto Him.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was this sleeping in Christ and this glorious
awakening, which to those early Christians, with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
simple unwavering faith, was a near and great reality,
of which the preacher spoke that night.</p>

<p>Casca, who had been studying deeply since he
came to Rome the words of poets and philosophers,
who had listened with profound attention to the
learned orations from the Rostra, and who had, even
before he had left Verulam, pondered much the
mysteries of life and death, now followed every word
with hungry eagerness.</p>

<p>The spirit of unbelief in the old system of the
gods was spreading rapidly.</p>

<p>The Olympus of old Rome was fading into thin
air.</p>

<p>Many in the educated and higher ranks of society
went through the form of attending the sacrifices, and
offering at the shrines on appointed festivals, who felt
it was but a form.</p>

<p>But here, in the dim seclusion of the Catacombs,
there was no formal acceptance of a creed&mdash;the
Christian faith was to the faithful an indwelling reality.</p>

<p>The young deacon who had questioned or catechised
the congregation, and instructed them by the
familiar form of question and answer, was followed
by an older man, a priest, who had been consecrated
by the bishop or overseer of that hidden Church in
the Catacombs of St. Calixta.</p>

<p>He, too, noticed and welcomed the strangers whom
Anna had brought, and Casca, the young Roman, in
his new and handsome toga virilis, interested him,
and he drew him aside and gave him a roll of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
manuscript, promising to supply him with others when
he returned these.</p>

<p>It was St Paul&#8217;s Epistle to the Hebrews, and
from the portion which tells of the great cloud of
witnesses the priest founded a discourse, or, as we
should call it, a sermon. He spoke of the invisible
watchers over that hidden Church; many had been
sufferers for Christ, and their bodies were lying in
niches of those long galleries awaiting the call of
their Master, which would be surely heard when He
came to claim His own. He spoke of the dangers
which surrounded the living, the torture and the
flame, the terrible ordeal of fire, or the fierce conflict
with the beasts. He described the scene which had
been enacted in the Coliseum that very day, and he
bade them all remember that their turn might come
next.</p>

<p>Were they ready? or would they faint and fail in
the trial hour?</p>

<p>They could do all things through Christ, who
strengthened them, and he would not allow that
one would turn back on the way to win the crown,
though the cross might be exceeding bitter and a sore
burden.</p>

<p>Prayers followed, and then the little company
were bidden to rest till the dawn broke. Just before
cock-crow the priest called them to awake and
draw near to receive the bread and wine for the refreshing
of their souls in remembrance of the sacrifice
of Christ. It was the first time that Casca or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
young Jewess had ever seen that solemn service. It
was familiar to Anna, and her thoughts went back to
the forests of Britain and the Radburn cave, where
the holy Amphibalus had broken that bread and
drunk of that cup, when dangers of every kind were
near.</p>

<p>It was no new thing to the British slave to feel
that the profession of the Christian faith was the
signal of danger. The scenes in the forest, in the
dark dungeon, were still as vivid as ever; but Casca
had yet to count the cost. The Jewish maiden felt
herself drawn to this Christ of whom the priest spoke.
The lines round her mouth softened, and tears
gathered on her long dark lashes, like rain-drops, and
slowly ran down her cheeks.</p>

<p>If only she dare believe that this Jesus of Nazareth
was the Messiah for whom her people had looked
for so long! but surely He, that long-looked-for King,
would come with imperial pomp and greatness; not,
as these his followers said, as the child of a humble
mother, to die a shameful death, such as malefactors
died!</p>

<p>Ah! that death of Christ! therein was hidden the
<i>Life</i>, though she knew it not as yet, nor could discern
it.</p>

<p>The little congregation were to separate at dawn,
and Casca was led by Anna through the long and
tortuous galleries to another entrance than that by
which they had come in.</p>

<p>It was scarcely more than a hole in the hill-side,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
and concealed by the immense profusion of the rare
yellow-berried ivy, which still hangs upon the Walls of
the Appian Way.</p>

<p>When they reached the opening, Anna said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must part here, dear master. I counsel you
to conceal the manuscript carefully, and read it with
prayer in secret. We may meet no more; for you pass
now to the grand life of Antonius, and I must remain
in the Jews&#8217; quarter, and you must run into no danger
in seeking me out. But I am often to be found here
at dark after sunset, and before sunrise, and it may
be that the desire of my heart may be granted, and
you will seek baptism at the hands of the Father in
Christ who spoke to us this night. Ah! it is morning
now; speed on your way.&#8221; Then Anna swept the overhanging
branches of ivy over the opening with her
hand, and disappeared, while Casca turned towards
the city along the Appian Way.</p>

<p>The first faint pallor of the dawn was touching the
colossal figures on the tombs, as Casca passed along.</p>

<p>In the dim and shadowy light these monuments of
the past seemed even more majestic than in the broad
glare of the noonday sun. The boy&#8217;s heart was filled
with a yearning longing after some certainty about the
future life which was almost pain.</p>

<p>All the great warriors who had fallen in battle for
their country covered with glory, whom these monuments
commemorated&mdash;where had they gone? That
dim region of the dead, whence the old traditions said
some favoured ones had been snatched by the strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
arm of the gods, and returned to those who loved
them&mdash;where was it? Had it, indeed&mdash;as many thought
in Rome&mdash;no existence but in the songs of the poet
and in the marble of the sculptor?</p>

<p>If the great multitude of whom nothing remained
but their ashes in the urns which were deposited in
the grand monuments were utterly gone; if the life
which had ended on the battle-field, or by their own
hand was over&mdash;quite over&mdash;how short it was! All
hopes and fears, and learning and culture, at an end.
Death! which must then mean nothingness?</p>

<p>But a voice in the boy&#8217;s soul told him of immortality;
that living witness within seemed to call on
him to believe that the spirit within him <i>could not die</i>.
With what certainty had the priest spoken of the cloud
of living witnesses&mdash;living, caring for those on earth&mdash;<i>loving</i>
them still! Surely, if this were true, it was a
grander and nobler thought than the consignment to
the depth of Hades, or the utter passing away and
annihilation of which so many orators he had lately
heard declare was the fate of every man! Casca
thought of his beautiful young sister in the temple of
Vesta, and remembered all their sweet converse at
home in the Villa of Severus, and on the long and
perilous journey to Rome. But she had gained her
heart&#8217;s desire, and she was satisfied. Surely her sweet
young face, as he had seen it in the garden on the
Cælian Hill, had a happy and satisfied halo shed
over it!</p>

<p>He had never seen her look so happy before. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
had left the luxurious frivolous life behind her, and
had entered upon her training for what was considered
the very highest vocation for a Roman maiden. She
had the privileges and honours of a vestal virgin before
her&mdash;possibly she might reach the highest office
of all, and her father&#8217;s rank made this probable; and
then, as Vestal Maxima, Hyacintha would have fulfilled
the most sanguine desires which any one who
knew her could cherish.</p>

<p>And yet even that must end. Hyacintha must die
and pass away from the temple; her beauty must fade,
her powers fail; death would not spare the vestal virgin
any more than the humblest peasant woman, like
those who had knelt with bowed heads and uplifted
hands before the priest, when he had given thanks
for their preservation from the lions.</p>

<p>Yes, death must pass on all men, and Anna, the
British slave, had been very near death; but she
looked beyond, to the crowd of invisible witnesses, to
Jesus, who had, so the priest said, &#8220;Overcome death,
and opened the gates of the kingdom.&#8221;</p>

<p>Casca remembered Ebba in the days that were
past&mdash;uncertain, trembling, fearful; but now that she
had confessed Christ openly, she had a look of resolute
purpose on her face, and her plain features were
often shining with a light which Casca felt was the
light of a steadfast faith, which no cruel death, no
terrible torture, could extinguish.</p>

<p>When the boy reached the villa of Antonius it was
broad daylight, and the outer court was filled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
slaves and servants preparing for the morning meal
and the day&#8217;s pleasure.</p>

<p>Several young men were returning from the night&#8217;s
carousal, and jested with each other on the speed with
which the young Casca had assumed all the privileges
of his manhood. They made many allusions which
Casca did not understand, and he passed through the
atrium, anxious to find his way to the rooms which
had been appointed for him.</p>

<p>Two attendants or slaves were waiting for him,
and prepared to conduct him to the bath, which, with
its rich mosaic pavement, was a necessary appendage
to every Roman villa.</p>

<p>The visit to the public baths came later in the
day, for these baths were the resorts of fashion and
pleasure. The two slaves helped Casca to lay aside
his dress, and as the toga slipped off the manuscript
roll fell out.</p>

<p>The elder slave picked it up, and a curious expression
flitted over his face, but he was silent. Indeed,
unless permitted to speak, these household
slaves were generally silent in the presence of their
superiors.</p>

<p>All Casca&#8217;s possessions of books and rolls and
pens and parchments were placed in a large coffer,
and the slave, lifting the lid, dropped the manuscript
into it.</p>

<p>Then the work of the morning proceeded. Casca
was conducted to the bath, and when he had bathed
his limbs in the clear water, he was rubbed with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
sweet-scented ointment, and then sprinkled with perfume.</p>

<p>After this a long linen robe was thrown over him,
and he was led back to his room, where two more
slaves awaited him, with richly-chased cups and flagons,
and some delicate dishes for the morning meal.</p>

<p>When he had eaten, the chamber was darkened
by the drawing of violet-coloured curtains over the
doors, and then he was left to dream away the early
part of the day, till the time came for resorting to the
public baths or the Coliseum, where there was frequently
a hand-to-hand gladiatorial fight, and wrestling
with beasts.</p>

<p>Antonius troubled himself very little about his new
inmate; he had received him in accordance with the
wishes of Severus, and he was to take him to the
palace at a convenient season, where he was to hold
some office about the Emperor&#8217;s person, when duly
qualified.</p>

<p>In this life, marked out for him by his father,
Casca would have been miserable, had it not been for
his studies and for the interest which his visits to the
Cæmeteria awakened in him. Little by little the boy
withdrew himself from the scenes of license and indulgence
which formed the atmosphere of the villa.
He was, like one who had gone before him, almost
persuaded to be a Christian, and yet he held back.
He was afraid to profess what he did not really feel,
and when he heard of many who recanted at the last
moment to avoid the torture or the fire, he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
argue with himself that it was better to be assured of
his own faith before he openly professed what in the
hour of trial he might be tempted to recant.</p>

<p>He was not sure of his own heart. Sometimes he
was lost in a maze of doubt and uncertainty; at others
he resigned himself to the calm philosophy of the
schools, which looked down from a high vantage-ground
on the old and young faith alike, and taught that the
life of man on earth, fleeting though it was, was all.
No beyond, and therefore, no anxiety as to the future&mdash;no
cold shadow of dark fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die,&#8221; was
the watchword of thousands in Rome in those days.</p>

<p>Then there were moments when, after careful study
of the manuscript which had been lent to him, he
would be strangely moved, and St. Paul&#8217;s eloquent
description of all those <i>who had died in the faith</i> would
fasten upon his imagination. Was not the same spirit
of endurance abroad at that very time? Some two
hundred and seventy years had gone by since St. Paul
had made up that grand roll of names of those who
esteemed the reproach of Christ greater riches than
any treasure, and there was the same tale of suffering
being told for the faith of which these men and women
were the valiant defenders. They had received the
promise, which promise reached beyond death to the
life eternal. &#8220;If only,&#8221; Casca thought, &#8220;he could know
that it was true, would he not have strength given him
to confess Christ openly.&#8221; Then the natural disposition
of the boy asserted itself, and he would turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
back to the philosophy of the schools, and try to rest
upon the hope rather than the belief that there was
no beyond.</p>

<p>Like many since that time, Casca could not surrender
his heart, and, lost in the mists of human
reasoning, he could not become a little child that he
might be wise.</p>

<p>Casca&#8217;s natural sweetness of disposition won him
friends in that large and pleasure-seeking household,
and the taunts and scoffs that he had at first to
endure, for his pure living and dislike of over-indulgence
and luxury, ceased. It was universally allowed
that Casca, the son of Severus, must be left to go on
his own way undisturbed, and as he never offended
any one, it was by common consent conceded that no
one should offend him.</p>

<small>JUNE, 313&mdash;THE FESTIVAL OF VESTA.</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Years</span> passed swiftly by, in the fourth century as
in the nineteenth!</p>

<p>They brought with them as they came many
changes, they bore away with them many hopes, and
left behind the memory of many sorrows, and the soft
radiance of many vanished joys!</p>

<p>The persecution of the Christians had in great
measure ceased, and, with the abdication of Diocletian,
the edicts for their arrest and slaughter had been
revoked.</p>

<p>It was comparatively a time of peace, and the
conflict between the old and the new faiths seemed
for a season at rest.</p>

<p>Constantius Chlorus had put a stop to the persecution
of the Christians in Britain in the year after
Alban had suffered, and now, in the year 313, Constantine
was Emperor, and well known to favour the
religion of Christ.</p>

<p>But if the old faiths were shaken to their very
foundations, every effort was made to put on an
appearance of increased enthusiasm at public ceremonials,
and to load the altars of the gods and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
goddesses with the choicest offerings and the most
costly sacrifices.</p>

<p>The great festival in honour of Vesta was to be
celebrated this year with excessive pomp and circumstance.
The preparations were organised on a very
large scale, and enormous offerings were continually
pouring in to the vestals&#8217; house and the temple, some
time before the great day, which fell on the ninth of
June.</p>

<p>The Vestal Maxima, Terentia Rufilla, was overwhelmed
with all the arrangements which devolved
upon her, and on the evening of the seventh of June
was lying on a couch in her own chamber, weary and
sad. A tall and most beautiful maiden was standing
at a marble slab or table covered with evergreens and
flowers, which she was weaving into wreaths and
emblems with her long slender fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come and rest, Hyacintha,&#8221; Terentia said; &#8220;come
and sit near me, I have much to say. To-morrow is
the day of your first ministration in the temple, and
you will henceforth be a priestess, fully qualified for
the service of the goddess. Surely, never had the
goddess a more beautiful and more true-hearted
servant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dearest lady,&#8221; Hyacintha said, &#8220;I feel but little
worthy to take the honour upon me; but my heart
rejoices to have the longing of years fulfilled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And thou hast no sad misgivings, dear child&mdash;no
longings for the ordinary lot of woman to trouble
thee; the home of the matron, the prattle of children&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
voices, the maternal joy and pride which we vestals
can never know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hyacintha&#8217;s pure untroubled face was raised to
that of her friend as she answered&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, I have no such longings; I am contented,
nay, thankful, to be free from all those cares which
harass the life of many a woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou art very young yet, dear child, though by
special permission thy ten years&#8217; probation has been
shortened. Although in the tenth year of thy discipleship,
it was not till the time of Pomona that first
thou camest hither. How my heart went out to thee
then, dear child, and how much we have been to each
other since!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Hyacintha said, &#8220;I have known great happiness
with thee, and my great ambition is, perhaps,
too great to tell even to thy ear. It is a high aim
indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Terentia smiled sadly as she laid her hand upon
the beautiful rings of clustering gold which shadowed
Hyacintha&#8217;s brow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thy ambition,&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;Thy high aim&mdash;what
is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was wandering last evening in the atrium,&#8221;
Hyacintha said, &#8220;and gazing, as I have done since I
was quite a child, at the figures of the past Vestals
which stand there. I have often spoken to them. I
feel almost as if I knew them all and their histories,
as you have told them. I do know Flavia Publicia
who has all the praises, and I cannot wonder, so gracious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
so beautiful is her face. But I love almost best
the face of Vibidia, who, as you have told me, so
generously protected poor Messalina. That is a grand
deed of any one to be remembered&mdash;it is so beautiful,
dearest lady, to protect the weak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that thy ambition, then, my sweet one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that is part of my ambition; but the <i>whole</i>
is to be a Vestal Maxima. Oh! do not think me
foolish, dearest lady, but I should love to have my
statue carved in marble, and stand for ever in our
noble hall, and for those who pass to read my name,
&#8216;Hyacintha Severa.&#8217; Is it too much to think of?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear child!&#8221; Terentia said, &#8220;when I called you
to rest by me, the thought was in my mind which you
have put into words.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow, as you know, you will take up your
full duties in the temple. The sculptor is to unveil
my likeness in the pure marble in which it was wrought.
It will not be placed with my noble predecessors till
I resign my high office or die while holding it. Then
it will be placed in either case in the atrium, and my
name will be followed by whatsoever it may please
the priest and the emperor to inscribe on the pedestal.
But I shall leave on record that it is my will that you
should be elected in my room, and that day may not
be far off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hyacintha&#8217;s eyes sought those of Terentia anxiously.
The joy of her announcement was tempered
with sorrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not leave us yet,&#8221; she said; &#8220;you must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
not speak of it. And I am young and untried, and I
fear&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What dost thou fear, dear child?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That many would consider others should take
place before me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The future is hidden,&#8221; said Terentia. &#8220;I may
live for years, instead of months; we will not speak
more of this now. Hast thou any longing beside?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay; except to hear of those I best love: Casca
my brother, and my faithful Ebba.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are both converts to the Christian faith.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Hyacintha said, &#8220;and they have had peaceful
times at Alexandria, whither they went with old
Ezra. I have been hoping for news from Britain to
reach me on this occasion of my full profession in the
temple, but none has come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thy father is now in the highest office in Verulam,
and perchance may send a special messenger.
He knows well that our festival is on the 9th of June,
and it is possible some word may be sent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dearest lady,&#8221; Hyacintha said, &#8220;does not all life
seem like a dream?&mdash;everything passing, nothing
staying. While we say &#8216;This is beautiful,&#8217; it is gone;
while we exult, the cause of exultation is over; while
we weep, the grief or the vexation is vanishing. Did
you ever feel as I do&mdash;as if I could not lay hold of,
or grasp anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I not felt it? Ah! child, a thousand times!
But, sure, you have no grief to make you weep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, not grief,&#8221; Hyacintha said; &#8220;not deep heart-grief,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
but vexations that arise in a large community
like ours; and sometimes if I try to stem a torrent of
gossip and bitterness the shafts turn on me, from the
young disciple, child though she be, C&#339;lia, in particular.
Not often,&#8221; she said, smiling, &#8220;not often, but
sometimes. And now that I shall have to instruct
those beneath me I feel there will be more trial.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not think you will fail, dear one,&#8221; Terentia
said; &#8220;you have had great success hitherto.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I look back on the records of the priestesses,&#8221;
Hyacintha said, &#8220;I can but feel that there must be
something stronger and more potent than mere will
which keeps us so secure. In all the long thousand
years that have passed since we were first entrusted
with the sacred fire, and Numa built us our first
temple, to preserve the palladium of Troy, so few have
failed to fulfil their vow. Surely this is a proof that
what we profess is the true faith. When I first came
hither, and Lucia told me of the punishment which
befel the vestals who broke their vow, I dreamed of
it, and used to fancy myself thrust into that dungeon
to starve&mdash;so fearful it is to think of&mdash;and yet&#8221;&mdash;&mdash;Hyacintha
paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me what is in thy heart, my daughter; do
not be afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; Hyacintha continued, &#8220;the disciples of
the new faith would cheerfully be shut into a dungeon
and starved rather than deny the Man of Nazareth
whom they worship. It must be a reality to them,
though a false mirage to us. Is it not so?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>Terentia Rufilla was silent. The young maiden,
standing at the eve of her full profession as a priestess
of the goddess Vesta, had only given words to thoughts
which seemed to crave for expression within her own
heart.</p>

<p>It must often have been so. The multitude, who
knew nothing beyond the old faith, and who were
content with the outside show and splendid pageantry
that marked a festival like that to be celebrated the
next day but one, in honour of Vesta, might be content.
But not the earnest, cultivated, highborn woman
like Terentia Rufilla, who had read much, and thought
much, and had put aside as beneath her consideration
the story of the Cross of Christ.</p>

<p>Now that the Church of the Catacombs had been
able to lift her head, and openly practise the rites
and celebrate the worship of the religion of Christ,
it was impossible that women like Terentia should
fail to consider what was forced upon their attention.
For the vestals did not lead a secluded life&mdash;the
seniors amongst them were well acquainted with what
passed in Rome, and it was impossible for them to be
ignorant of the rapid advances which Christianity was
making. It was all very well for the careless and
idle to ignore the fact, and deny that the old temple was
in danger, and the old ceremonies growing effete and
languishing. To the thoughtful observer, the base and
mean, the low and contemptible religion, was growing
apace, and its branches were casting their shadows on
every side.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Terentia said, &#8220;at least the delusion is
apparently no delusion in the eyes of the poor
misguided ones who follow it. As a child may try to
reach the horizon line which meets the wide-spread
Campagna, the sky seeming to touch the earth, and
the child believes it does touch it, and runs fast and
faster, and lies down at last exhausted, after a fruitless
chase. Let us say no more of the Christians now,
Hyacintha, but tell me if thy robe is ready for the
morrow, and thy two-eared pitcher prepared for the
first mission thou hast to perform?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dearest lady. I am to go alone to the
fountain unattended, and bring the fresh water to the
goddess&#8217;s shrine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The lictor must attend thee to the gate of the
garden, and await thy return. Then follows the choice
of a new disciple. They become less and less
numerous every year. I can recall the time when
twice twenty young children were waiting to be chosen,
and how those who were rejected were often sent
away weeping. For the last two years the number has
been small, and the noble houses have sent but few
aspirants. I remember when thou first camest, dear
child, a little wayworn maiden clinging to the hand of
Cl&#339;lia, who brought thee to the atrium, timidly, and
uncertain of thy reception. The daughter of Severus
needed no introduction to me in any case, but how
gladly I welcomed thee, my fair and lovely one!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hyacintha pressed her lips upon the hand which
was wound round her neck, and then the two were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
silent&mdash;that silence of perfect sympathy and affection
which is so sweet, sweeter far than any words.</p>

<p>The shadows deepened in the house of the vestals
early in the evening of the glorious June day. Even
at noontide the light in the atrium and state apartments
was dim, for the Palatine cliff was behind
them, and the wall really supported the road above
it. The Imperial palace rose to the height of a
hundred and fifty feet in the air; and it is not surprising
that sunshine, even at midsummer, only touched
the upper floor, and left the vast area below chill and
dim with a mysterious light.</p>

<p>Damp must have been an enemy to the health of
the vestals; but the recent discoveries have brought to
light some curious devices by which the enemy was
combated.</p>

<p>Double walls have been unearthed, and double
floors, with skilfully diverted currents of hot air which
flowed through the interstices, must have in some measure
warmed and dried the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Hyacintha could hardly sleep, when at last she
retired for the night. She feared so much that she
should not be awake at dawn, that she begged Lucia
to call her at the first cock-crow. But long before the
old vestal had thought of going to her chamber to
rouse her, Hyacintha was up and ready to start.</p>

<p>She was conducted by a lictor to the gate of the
garden, where we saw her as a child, and went with
the swift light foot of a young fawn to the spring on
the Cælian Hill. She carried the two-eared vase or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
jug gracefully poised on her head, and she was leaning
against the rock whence the spring flowed, the
very type of youthful beauty and radiant health. The
dim shadows of the vestals&#8217; house had left her untouched;
no damp had been enough to steal the rose-colour
from her cheeks, nor the lustre from her beautiful
eyes. She was indeed a vision of loveliness, and
the tall athletic soldier who, scaling the hill, came all
unawares upon her, as Ebba had done years before,
might be forgiven, if, with a sudden start, he drew
back, and exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The goddess herself, methinks!&#8221; He was about
to bend the knee before Hyacintha, when he suddenly
drew himself erect, and contenting himself with taking
off his heavy helmet, he stood, with bowed head,
transfixed.</p>

<p>Hyacintha&#8217;s cheeks grew crimson, her lips parted
as if to speak, but no sound came. The long years
which lay between her and the home of her childhood
seemed bridged over. Memories of all that had
passed in the little upper chamber at Verulam came
thronging back, words spoken there, a promise made,
all flashed upon her, and then with a voice that was
like sound of silvery music, she said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Claudius! it is indeed Claudius!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even so, fair and beautiful lady,&#8221; the soldier said.
&#8220;I am Claudius, and had I not renounced the worship
of the false gods, I should lie prostrate at your feet,
and do you sacrifice.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>&#8220;Nay, do not speak like that, good Claudius,&#8221;
Hyacintha said. &#8220;I pray you, let me hear if you bring
me news from Verulam.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have seen much foreign service since I left
Verulam,&#8221; Claudius said; &#8220;I have led a battalion
against the northern tribes. I have won my way, and
I am now in Rome the commander of a legion of fine
troops. Where is Casca?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas! he left Rome some years ago. He is, or
was, when last I had tidings of him, at Alexandria,
whither he accompanied Ezra and the faithful Ebba.
My brother and Ebba are both Christians. Alas, that
I should say it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I well know that Ebba is a Christian,&#8221; Claudius
said; &#8220;you have heard that I fulfilled my vow to you,
and saved the British slave&#8217;s life?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes! ah, yes! good Claudius, I thank you.
Ebba has told me of the noble deed, and Casca, too,
has spoken of you. But I have seen neither of them
for years. I thank you now for your deed of valour,
good Claudius.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she stood in the light of the early morning,
Claudius could not have drawn nearer or taken her
hand in his. An invisible but strong barrier seemed
to keep him back.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father,&#8221; she asked, &#8220;is there news of him? I
know my mother is dead, and the little Livia also.
These tidings were brought me by Caius, whose galley
has been several times to Londinium since those far-off
days, when he brought us hither, Casca and me.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>&#8220;Your father, the noble Severus, has married my
sister Junia. Has he never told you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Hyacintha said, the blush on her cheek
fading. &#8220;No, I hear it now for the first time. I
would I had never heard it; forgive me, for Junia is
your sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no need to claim forgiveness. I think
as hardly of my sister as any one, but I pray daily
for her conversion, and I will believe not in vain, for
the Lord can change the heart and bring sweetness
out of bitterness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Art thou too a Christian?&#8221; Hyacintha asked, with
an almost imperceptible start backwards.</p>

<p>&#8220;A Christian,&#8221; Claudius said, &#8220;ay, verily, and I
would to God you were one also.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I,&#8221; said Hyacintha, proudly. &#8220;Nay, this day is
my happy day, the day when I, who have been for
near ten years training under the care of the sacred
virgins, have my lot appointed me to minister in the
temple and sprinkle the shrine with this pure water,
which I have been allowed to draw myself alone at
dawn for the first time. To-morrow is our glad festival,
and we shall walk through the city in a long procession,
and to-night I shall for the first time keep
watch alone in the temple. It is a great and wonderful
thing to be a vestal! I would not exchange my
lot for an Imperial diadem,&#8221; she said, with a proud
dignified motion of her head. &#8220;I would I were more
worthy to fulfil so high a destiny.&#8221;</p>

<p>Claudius, who had led a Roman phalanx against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
hordes of barbarians, and had never feared danger or
shrunk from death, felt strangely timid in the presence
of this beautiful friend of his early years.</p>

<p>He had kept her image before him, as the winning,
lovely child, so full of earnestness of purpose, so gentle
and tender to the slaves in her mother&#8217;s household, so
full of sympathy with their pain and trouble, so devoted
in her service of affection to her delicate and
weakly brother. Claudius had preserved her image as
a child, and loved her; now she was standing before
him in the full beauty of her womanhood, and he felt
his love was nearly worship. He was a Christian now.
He had been won to embrace the faith by the example
of a few who professed Christianity amongst Constantine&#8217;s
army. Claudius had been with the Emperor&#8217;s
force, when he went to repress an incursion of the
Franks, one of the hardy Northern tribes on the banks
of the Rhine. It was just at the time when the
treacherous Maximian had taken advantage of Constantine&#8217;s
absence to seize all the treasure at Arles,
and dispensing it amongst the soldiers who were
stationed in Southern Gaul, hoped to establish his
authority by gifts and bribes. But before that was
done Constantine had returned with extraordinary quickness,
and Claudius had been with his army when he
arrived at the gates of Arles with a force which it was
impossible to resist, and which scarcely gave him time
to take refuge in the nearest city of Marseilles.</p>

<p>Claudius had indeed seen much active service
since he had gone out with Valens to pursue the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
band of Christians in the forest near Radburn, and
many a time the cries and tears of that innocent and
inoffensive little band seemed to sound in his ears
and reproach him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the first time I ever felt that
the religion of Christ must be a reality was when I
saw that brave woman Agatha quietly submit to receive
the dead Jewish girl in the dark dungeon, and,
faint and exhausted, as it proved, even to death, make
no murmur at the lonely vigil with the dead to which
I left her. I would not speak to you here,&#8221; Claudius
continued, &#8220;of my deeds of prowess. Those scenes in
which I have taken part are no theme for your ear,
most beautiful Hyacintha, but I would fain tell you,
that face to face with death a hundred times, I have
felt the power of God within me was mighty to save.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the last great fight at Saxa Rubra, where we
came unawares upon the army of Maxentius, I fought
side by side with the friend who has so deeply influenced
me. He was a Christian indeed, and though
he defended himself valiantly, he indulged in no barbaric
cruelty, such as we soldiers have often witnessed,
and&mdash;I say it with shame&mdash;indulged in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The story of that battle is well known amongst
us,&#8221; Hyacintha said. &#8220;We have been rid of the tyrant
Maxentius, and Rome may have rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There can be but little rest,&#8221; said Claudius. &#8220;I,
for one, am weary of the clang of arms and fighting.
Methinks I shall resign my high post, and try to find
Casca in the far-off city where you say he is gone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
The roar of the vanquished ones as they rushed to
meet their fate in the swift-flowing Tiber sounds in
my ear many a time and oft, and I would fain lay
down my arms. I have had a glut of battles, and
could almost take up Casca&#8217;s cry of&mdash;&#8216;Anything but
bloodshed.&#8217; I am a rough fellow, I know, but Christianity
can tame the roughest, and subdue the most
ferocious nature. It would lift <i>you</i>,&#8221; he continued,
in a voice faltering from deep emotion, &#8220;to the very
height of the angelic host.&#8221;</p>

<p>A smile broke over Hyacintha&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Claudius,&#8221; she said; &#8220;I am in no need of
exaltation, neither of humiliation. For when I think
of all the great privileges which lie before me to-day&mdash;of
the lonely watch before the altar of Vesta, and
of the part which I shall take to-morrow in the great
festival, I feel, methinks, as if my heart swelled with
proud thankfulness.</p>

<p>&#8220;The time is come for me,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;to
return, for the sun is getting high above the horizon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; she said, stretching out her arms to the
lovely view before her. &#8220;How beautiful the city is!
how grand! how like a queen! and surely I am highly
favoured to be allowed to minister at the sacred altar,
and keep alive the purifying flame which shall ensure
the safety of thousands in Rome.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Little do you dream in your seclusion of all the
wickedness that seethes like a turbid fountain whose
waters cast up mire and dirt in Rome!&#8221; Claudius exclaimed.
&#8220;It may be well that you, in your purity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
and innocence, should know but little&mdash;nay, nothing&mdash;of
all that lies below the surface&mdash;greed, and lust,
and murder, all those things which are the signs and
token, or, rather, the fruits of the flesh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not tell me more,&#8221; Hyacintha said. &#8220;I cannot
amend what is wrong. I am content to believe,
as those higher and nobler than I am have believed
for a thousand years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you indeed content to believe?&#8221; Claudius
asked sadly. &#8220;I know that if I were to draw a picture
of all, that after only a short residence, <i>I</i> see in Rome,
you would not be content. The wife and daughter of
Diocletian have been foully murdered. Think you
not that the blood of the Christian matrons and
maidens who fell under the ban of the Emperor did
not cry for vengeance, and that the cry was answered
by their destruction?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The innocent suffering for the guilty? Nay,&#8221; said
Hyacintha, with a light laugh; &#8220;if the God whom you
worship decrees such judgment, He is not worthy of
love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; said Claudius, &#8220;and yet in the sufferings
of Christ, the pure, the undefiled, for the sinner,
rests our safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay! not your safety,&#8221; exclaimed Hyacintha; &#8220;or
why did Christ leave so many to perish, torn by wild
beasts, stoned, and tortured?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am no scholar,&#8221; Claudius said. &#8220;I am not like
Casca, learned in argument and reasoning, but there
is in me a witness to the truth of what I say. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
innocent suffered for the guilty, and there is salvation
in that suffering for all who believe; and I <i>know</i> in
whom I believe!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hyacintha was silent. Claudius had always seemed
to her in her childish days a brave and athletic youth,
when feats of arms and success in the games had so
often brought her father&#8217;s angry and contemptuous
taunts on the head of her brother Casca.</p>

<p>Many a time had she heard him declare that
Claudius ought to have been his son, and that the
weakly Casca was scarcely better than a girl. Hyacintha
had often shrunk from Claudius&#8217;s roughness,
his boisterous laugh, his loud ringing voice as he
rallied Casca on his depression. Now she could but
tell herself there was a change. The face, bronzed by
exposure, and scarred in two places by a sword-cut,
was benign and gentle in its expression. The voice
that came from under that mass of reddish hair was
subdued and even musical. Claudius was changed&mdash;what
had brought about that change? She was, I
think, unconscious that as she stood there&mdash;the most
winning and beautiful picture of womanhood&mdash;that
she filled Claudius&#8217;s strong and noble heart with longing
to possess her&mdash;to take her from this false faith,
to bring her to the foot of the Cross, that she might
live in the true light that lighteth every man.</p>

<p>Hyacintha&#8217;s was one of those pure and noble
natures to whom service is a necessity, and who can
know no selfish and ignoble aims.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>There was never a little disciple in distress about
a torn garment or a neglected lesson but she came to
Hyacintha for help. There was not wanting the
mean spirit of jealousies amongst the vestals; bitter
tongues were often in motion; rivalries, and anxieties
for the best places at the games, and for notice from
those in power were rife; the choicest viands at the
table were eagerly sought; and the weariness and
lassitude which are born of the service which is not
heart-service, and therefore becomes drudgery, continually
produced ill-temper, which is so often the outcome
of discontent. It was rare, indeed, to find Hyacintha
cross or angry; she bore and forbare, and won
her way through all the trials of her surroundings
with a wonderful patience.</p>

<p>Her relationship to Terentia Rufilla, and the close
friendship which existed between them, excited, as
was only probable, the envy of many of her companions.
But ill-will could not flourish near her. The
bright serenity of her nature triumphed over every
obstacle, and, like the sun, dispersed the clouds around
her, as day by day she rose higher in the estimation
of those with whom she shared the daily routine of
the Vestals&#8217; House.</p>

<p>That these noble characters were by no means uncommon
in the days of which I write is beyond a
question. They shine out amongst the records of
those times like stars in the firmament, and many
women like Hyacintha Severa have, when converted
to the faith of Christ, shown that they were true as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
steel and steadfast as a rock, and glad to suffer and
to die for the name of Christ.</p>

<p>The fountain rippled, and the falling of the water
made a low, monotonous murmur; the sun rising above
the hills turned every dew-drop into a diamond, and
lay upon the turf, which was jewelled with flowers in
golden bands.</p>

<p>Hyacintha stood lost in meditation, Claudius watching
her.</p>

<p>He drew a step nearer, and she started, as if from
a happy dream; then he spoke in low, earnest tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hyacintha, would that I could think you knew in
whom you believe. Sweet friend, I will pray for you,
and my prayers&mdash;rough and untaught soldier as I am&mdash;ascending
continually, will be heard. I would not
hurt a hair of your head,&#8221; he continued, earnestly.
&#8220;I would not even bring the shadow of a cloud over
you. I know that you have vowed to give up all
loves of earth, and that the vow you have taken is the
vow for life. Were you other than what you are, I
might tell you of the love I bear you&mdash;a love which
has kept me in the thickest onslaught of temptation! As
you keep the sacred fire on the altar, so have I kept
this love for you in my heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will burn there till I die, and after death it
will still live on.... Nay,&#8221; he said, as he saw the
swift blush mantle Hyacintha&#8217;s cheek&mdash;&#8220;nay, I would
not awaken in you one troubled thought. I shall never
possess you, but the love I bear you is deathless. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
seem to see in the future a land more beautiful than
mortal eye has ever looked upon, and there something
tells me I shall find you, my beautiful one, in
garments whiter even than that you now wear, and
bought for you by the Innocent who suffered for the
guilty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Claudius, like many another man who has loved as
a pure, good man only can love, seemed carried into
eloquence by the force of the feeling within him.</p>

<p>He knelt for a moment at Hyacintha&#8217;s feet, took
her hand and kissed it, and the next moment he was
gone.</p>

<p>The awakening had come for the Vestal on the
very eve of her full admission to the duties she had
so longed for: that awakening comes to most of us;
and there was never a true and good woman who
could lightly esteem the devotion of a noble-hearted
man.</p>

<p>Hyacintha stood leaning against the rock whence
the fountain flowed; for a few moments her heart
beat fast, and her eyes were dim with unbidden tears,
as she thought over all that Claudius had said.</p>

<p>He was, indeed, in earnest; truth was written on
his fine face; and truth rang out in the tones of his
voice.</p>

<p>For a few minutes a vague longing possessed her&mdash;a
longing which could hardly be clothed in words.
Then she smiled as she said, softly&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Claudius! Brave, noble Claudius! May he
find all the happiness he craves for me!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>The two-eared vase was raised by her unfaltering
hand, so that not one crystal drop was spilled as she
bore it on her stately head, and went down to the gate
where the lictors had awaited her coming patiently,
wondering much at her long delay.</p>

<small>VANISHING.</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Throughout</span> that day of preparation for the
festival, the new priestess was continually thinking of
her interview with Claudius on the Cælian Hill. Not
even the new dignities which were conferred on her
could entirely banish from her mind the words and
bearing of the old companion of her childish days in
Britain.</p>

<p>It was a grand thing to sprinkle with her own
hands the sacred shrine and Palladium, to be consecrated
solemnly by the priest for all the functions of
her office, as she had once been dedicated as a child
to be trained to fulfil them.</p>

<p>The beautiful new garments of spotless purity
were solemnly placed upon her, and when the ceremony
was over, and she had rested for a time,
Terentia Rufilla led her to her place behind the altar,
and gave into her charge the sacred fire, which was
to be replenished continually during the silent hours
of the night.</p>

<p>Then, with a kiss, the Vestal Maxima departed,
the temple door was closed, and Hyacintha was alone.</p>

<p>Through the opening in the roof the deep blue
sky of the Italian night was seen, studded with stars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
and from afar came the sound of the surging multitudes
of Rome, like the distant roar of the sea, growing
less and less distinct as the summer night hushed
even the busy throngs of the Roman citizens to rest.</p>

<p>Hyacintha felt a sense of awe, but not of fear.
She looked up at the face of the figure of the goddess,
and then beyond it, upwards to the stars, and she felt
as far from the one as from the other.</p>

<p>There was no bond of love between Vesta and her
priestess, no sign that for her she felt any particular
care or affection.</p>

<p>It was a high honour to be her priestess; from
her childhood she had craved for it, and now the
honour was hers, and yet, surely, there was a void, a
want somewhere, which Vesta could not fill.</p>

<p>It was service for Rome to guard that sacred fire,
and as she moved gently, with a sort of hushed reverence,
to the silver vessels where the fuel was kept, to
replenish that clear bright flame, she almost started at
her own movements, and scarcely dared to breathe, as
she gently and reverently fed the sacred fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is for the good of Rome and her people,&#8221; she
thought, &#8220;it is a service which many thousands might
envy, but there is scarce the response within my heart
of which Claudius spoke; did he not call it &#8216;a witness.&#8217;
I felt a great glow of joy to-day when I took poor
little Pulcheria to my chamber, and consoled her for
her grief that she was not thought fair enough to lead
the procession of the children disciples through Rome
to-morrow. Poor little one! how she wept because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Valeria had been elected and she was rejected. As she
threw her arms round my neck and sobbed out that
she loved to be with me, and that she would not care
about Valeria&#8217;s unkind words if I were her friend, I
felt that sweetness at my heart which I do not feel
here. Here, where I am fulfilling the most beautiful
of offices&mdash;the guardian of the Palladium&mdash;the replenishing
of the sacred flame!</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought to be satisfied and happy, with a happiness
greater than that of the pleasure-seeking ladies,
whose life is passed in indulgence, and who die at
last, worn out with the search for that, to judge by
many sad faces, they never find.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a higher and nobler destiny to fulfil, and
I can never become like old Lucia or Agrippina, who
go through all the service of the temple with slow
unwilling feet, dark sad eyes, and even mutter words
of dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor can I ever grow into the nearly worn out
victim of pleasure, still less the sorrowful, heavy-hearted
priestess, whose service has lost its charm.
Nay, for the twenty years I may spend here my life
shall at least be happier than that of my poor mother,
who died, as some have said, by poison, administered
by a slave whom she had hated. Yet, how beautiful
she was in the atrium at Verulam, with Ebba&mdash;dear
Ebba&mdash;standing at her side. I can see her now,
toying with her lovely hair, when Ebba had plaited
into the tresses the gold ornaments and arranged the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
long violet ribbons with their gold fringe. Poor Ebba,
and dear Casca! Shall I ever see them again?&#8221;</p>

<p>This desultory train of thought flowed on during
the watches of the short night. For the summer
morning of the ninth of June soon broke over the
hills, and touched the Forum and the Temple, and the
façades of the Imperial Palace, and the long vista of
stately figures on the Appian Way, with a soft rosy
light. The day of the great festival dawned in exquisite
beauty, and everyone within the precincts of
the Temple and the House of the Vestals was astir.</p>

<p>But the great festival did not attract so much
attention as in former years. Even in the early days
of her own priesthood, Terentia Rufilla remembered
how far more numerous were the applications from
noble houses for a place in the procession through
the streets of Rome. Nevertheless, the effect was
sufficiently imposing, as the long line flowed past the
spectators, with all the garlands and crowns fluttering
gently in the summer air.</p>

<p>The children came first&mdash;sweet grave-eyed little
maidens&mdash;with offerings in their hands for the altar of
Jupiter Pistor, which was erected expressly for the
occasion. Then came the fully-consecrated vestals,
barefooted, in their flowing robes, which became them
so well.</p>

<p>Conspicuous amongst these was Hyacintha Severa.
She carried the folds of her large purple mantle with
wonderful grace over her arm, and her long white
robe flowing beneath it to her feet, showed the outline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
of her beautifully-proportioned figure to the greatest
advantage.</p>

<p>The close covering on her head, which was to
some women far from becoming, seemed only to
enhance the beauty of her slender throat, upon which
her head was set like a flower upon a stalk. Long
ribbons floated at the back, and added to the effect of
the picture, of which the recent discoveries of the
figures in the Vestals&#8217; House, which the sculptors of
those days delighted to perpetuate in marble, have
given us some faint idea. But no sculptor or painter
could perpetuate the grave happiness which was shed,
like the soft halo of a summer night upon a lovely
landscape, over the face of Hyacintha Severa.</p>

<p>As the last fully-consecrated Vestal, she walked a
little in front of the five who followed her, and then
came the noble and stately form of Terentia Rufilla.
She had lost, of course, all the charms of youth, but
her features were finely cut, and her carriage stately
and imposing. There were many gorgeously-dressed
Roman ladies behind her, whose splendid crimson and
violet robes, glistening with jewels and sparkling with
pearls, contrasted well with the long train of white-robed
maidens which wound slowly on before them
through crowds of spectators, the lictors clearing the
road which was in many places strewn with flowers as
they walked.</p>

<p>Claudius was amongst the outside crowd which
moved along with the procession. His high rank as
Commander of the Forces under the Emperor Constantine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
ensured him respect, and he and a few of his
officers who were with him, drew up in martial array
before the temple, as the Vestals passed in to the
great sacrifice.</p>

<p>Some of his officers crossed the threshold and
stood gazing at the high ceremonial with curiosity,
prostrating themselves in that mechanical way which
characterised the religious services of the temple in
those the last days of the worship of the heathen gods.</p>

<p>Claudius&#8217;s great height placed him on a vantage-ground,
and he could see over the heads of the dense
crowd before him. He had never once lost sight of
Hyacintha, but she was utterly unconscious of his presence.
All the enthusiasm of her nature was awakened
by this public acknowledgment of the service to which
she had devoted her life.</p>

<p>As the priest in his gorgeous vestments sacrificed
before the goddess, and the clouds of smoke rose and
ascended to the sky through the impluvium or open
space in the roof, Hyacintha&#8217;s heart went up to One
whom she &#8220;ignorantly worshipped;&#8221; and if the desire
of her soul could have been put into words, it would
have been that she might be kept pure in her temple
ministry, and that the fire of devotion might be ever
burning clear and bright in her heart, as she had
vowed to keep the sacred flame burning on the altar
of Vesta. While many of her companions were looking
around them, to see what friends and acquaintances
were in the crowd, Hyacintha was lifted far above the
throng of worshippers, and gazers on the spectacle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
and thought only of the joy of service, and the happiness
of being at last a fully-consecrated priestess, one
of a long line which reached back a thousand years,
and reached forward, as she believed, to a future age.</p>

<p>The young priestess that day entering upon her
office had no presentiment of what was indeed the
fact, that the years of the Vestals were numbered, and
that Terentia Rufilla was to have but two successors
as Vestal Maxima, and that one of these was herself.
Terentia, however, knew that many new influences
were at work, which were undermining the old traditions
or scattering them to the winds of heaven. The
fear at her heart was as great as the joy which filled
Hyacintha&#8217;s, and she could scarcely assume a cheerful
aspect at the banquet, to which many of the highest
families in Rome were bidden.</p>

<p>The whole day was one of feasting, and games
were celebrated, and the Vestals were present in the
Circus Maximus, where seats were, as in the Coliseum,
always reserved for them near those allotted to the
Emperor.</p>

<p>It was there that Hyacintha first seemed to be
conscious of Claudius&#8217;s presence, and when he saluted
her with profound respect, she turned to Terentia, and
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is good Claudius, my father&#8217;s friend,&#8221; and
Terentia was not slow to notice how the soft blush
rose to Hyacintha&#8217;s cheek, as she pronounced the few
words of introduction.</p>

<p>So the day wore on in feasting and pleasure, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
then the shadows of the evening came down upon the
city. Hyacintha, who was sleeping after the fatigue of
the day, was awakened by Terentia&#8217;s voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is drawing near the hour for thy watch, dear
child,&#8221; she said; &#8220;shall I watch to-night, and let thee
dream? I have been looking at thy sleeping face for
some minutes,&#8221; she said, gently smoothing back the
golden-brown rings of short hair which clustered round
Hyacintha&#8217;s brow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Happy dreams they must surely have been, for
there was a smile upon thy lips.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Hyacintha said, &#8220;I had a vision, I think.
Wait till I recall it,&#8221; and she drew her hand across her
eyes, and pressed it on her forehead. &#8220;I remember,&#8221;
she said,&mdash;&#8220;yes, I remember now. I thought I was
looking down on Rome from a high place&mdash;not the
Cælian Hill or the Quirinal&mdash;it was a hill far higher.
Indeed, I saw them beneath me, and I saw the temples
beneath me, and our temple most distinctly of all.
Then, as I looked, it vanished. It was not thrown
down or destroyed; it melted into air slowly&mdash;very
slowly; but soon it was gone: and then I looked around
me, and lo! all the temples were fading, and a voice
spoke to me, and it was the voice of a humble but
true friend&mdash;Ebba, or Anna, the British slave. She,
too, was changed. She wore garments like ours, only
whiter and more dazzling, and she held out her hand
to me, and asked me to go up with her to the city to
which she pointed. But when I looked I could see
only a golden glory, and nothing distinctly. My eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
were dazzled, and I turned away. Then Ebba drew
me on and told me to listen, for there was sweet
music. But my ears were dull; I could not hear what
she heard. Then she took me in her arms, and I laid
my head upon her breast, as I have often done when
I was a child; and she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Not yet&mdash;not yet; but you are coming out of the
darkness into the light.&#8217; And a sweet peace stole over
me, and I felt a cool hand on my brow; and then I
awoke, and it was not Ebba at all, but you, dearest
lady&mdash;sweet mother&mdash;as I love to call you. It was a
happy dream; and it is a happy awakening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a vision,&#8221; Terentia said, &#8220;for I do believe
the temples are vanishing, and soon only the memory
will be left. I say soon; it may not be in my life-time
or in yours; but the end is coming, and the time
of our nightly watches yonder is short. I hear a
rumour to-day that an edict establishing Christianity
will be published to-morrow, and then the old faiths
will be seen like the phantom of your dream&mdash;vanishing&mdash;vanishing,
and at last vanish away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what will be the end?&#8221; Hyacintha asked;
&#8220;what will come after?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, child; it is not given me to know, nor even
dimly guess; but if there be a future at all, that future
is not for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sorrowful tone of Terentia&#8217;s voice seemed like
the minor chord in the music of the young priestess&#8217;s
soul. Vanishing&mdash;vanishing&mdash;vanished! Was everything
to vanish?&mdash;life and youth and hope, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
sacred fire, and the Palladium, and the goddess herself&mdash;all
to pass away, and leave no trace behind?
Well, it was not for her to question, or cavil, or doubt.
The daily service of the temple&mdash;the nightly watch&mdash;these
were marked out for her&mdash;these were, at any
rate, real and tangible. She would perform them
zealously and faithfully, and make each day like a
pearl, which should prove ere long a strong chain,
uniting her with the Great Past, and so making a
bond with all her predecessors who had kept their
vow and their womanhood pure and undefiled. With
that simplicity which is the outcome of the highest
gifts, with that entire absence of self-consciousness
which invariably marks those whose beauty is far beyond
the ordinary type of fair women, Hyacintha
Severa stands forth to command our love and admiration
as a light that shone in a dark place&mdash;a star
that trembled on the verge of dawn, the dawn of a
holier and purer day, which was even then breaking
over the world.</p>

<p>The festival of the goddess Vesta had scarcely
passed when a crowd assembled in the Forum to hear
the proclamation, that henceforth the Christians were
to be allowed freedom to worship their God without
being interfered with; and from that time Christianity
might be said to be established in Rome and the
world.</p>

<p>Great were the rejoicings in the Church. The
hidden worship of the Catacombs became now open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
and to be heard and seen of all men. The orders of
the Christian Church were enlarged, and bishops and
priests and deacons were appointed to minister to the
people. The sun had risen, at last, over the darkness
of the heathen world, and in those early days was as
yet but little clouded by the mists of earth, by those
&#8220;superstitious vanities&#8221; which so grievously eclipsed
the glory of the Church of Rome in succeeding generations.</p>

<p>Now there was purity of life and doctrine, and,
like Claudius, thousands were won over by the example
of the converts rather than by the preaching of the
priests.</p>

<p>The witness in every man&#8217;s soul who turned to the
living God made itself seen in the life and conversation,
and there were dark places indeed in that year
of Christian freedom which made the opening of the
Christian life more beautiful by force of contrast.</p>

<p>In this very year&mdash;313&mdash;the most shameful life of
Maximian, and his treatment of the unhappy Valeria,
the widow of Galerius, had made even the luxurious
Roman shudder with horror. The story of the foul
murders at Nicomedia reached Rome, and filled many
hearts with sorrow. If the religion of Christ showed
the way of escape from such wicked passions and low
base deeds, there was safety in it.</p>

<p>And then, on the lower ground of personal security,
many professed themselves to be Christians; many who
had not troubled themselves to inquire into the doctrines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
of Christ&#8217;s disciples, saw that they practised
purity of life and manners, and now that there was
no persecution or torture to dread, Christianity became
more widely accepted, and the churches were thronged,
while the temples were deserted.</p>

<p>It is not possible to take a comprehensive view of
the Roman empire at this time. The few incidents
which are thrown together, directly or indirectly, affect
the action of the story, but a careful study of these
early days of Christianity, and the last days of
heathenism, will well repay the student; and the secret
of silent advance and growth of the faith of Christ
will be found to be then, as now, more in the influence
of individual character than in fierce controversy or
angry invective.</p>

<p>The Church of Rome, as it sprang to light when
the edict of 313 was published, was indeed different
from the Church, many centuries later, when the Monk
of Erfurt entered the city by the Porta del Popoli, full
of enthusiasm, and ready to climb the &#8220;Scala Santa&#8221;
on his knees in expiation of his sins.</p>

<p>He entered it a devout son of the Church of the
Seven Hills; he left it depressed, disgusted, but determined
to do battle, like the valiant soul that he was,
against its corrupt practices. In ten years the young
monk who had saluted the city on his first entrance
as Holy Rome, Rome venerable with the blood of the
martyrs, burned the Pope&#8217;s Bull in the square of Wittenberg,
and with a loud voice, which echoed through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Christendom, proclaimed that the Church of the Early
Martyrs was so overlaid by the wickedness of a corrupt
age, that she must be utterly purged of defilement,
before she could be resorted to as the mother under
whose wings the people might safely take refuge.</p>

<small>A.D. 333&mdash;ALEXANDRIA.</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Again</span> many years have passed away, and Casca,
the son of Severus, is leaning back in his old languid
fashion on a couch placed near a window commanding
one of the loveliest views upon which the eyes of
man have ever rested.</p>

<p>The house was near that magnificent Museum of
Alexandria, which, with its famous library, was famous
beyond all fame of later times, a fitting treasure-house
for its precious manuscripts, and raising a grand white
roof against a sky whence rain seldom fell, and turning
its noble frontage of pillars and fresco toward the
sapphire plain of the tideless Mediterranean.</p>

<p>There were no signs of undue luxury about Casca.
The furniture of his room was simple, and yet suggestive
of grace and elegance. Large piles of manuscripts
lay on shelves, ranged on one side of the room,
and in another were the toys of a child, heaped up
in confusion, as they had evidently been left by some
little tired fingers that were weary of play. The room
where Casca sat was divided by a portière from an
inner chamber, and a murmur might be heard from it
of a woman&#8217;s voice, singing in low monotonous tones.</p>

<p>Below the wide open window there was borne on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the soft warm air the sound of chariot wheels passing
in the street; the cry of the charioteer, the voice of
the newsman, and now and then the low growl, which
told that the menagerie was near at hand. The sound
which was &#8220;the electric touch&#8221; that the Poet speaks
of, awoke memories in Casca&#8217;s heart of that day, so
many years before, when the roar of the wild beasts
which were to tear the Christians to pieces, floated to
his ear as he passed by the Forum to the schools at
Rome. He remembered the horror he had always felt
at such sounds, and how once when Antonius had insisted
on his accompanying him to a great fight with
the beasts, he had fainted away, and on recovery had
heard the mocking laugh of some of his companions,
and the scornful words of Antonius:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bear him hence; he has not the courage of an
infant of days.&#8221;</p>

<p>How dreamlike it all seemed now&mdash;the fate of his
patron Antonius, his flight, disgraced and dishonoured,
from his princely villa; the return for a time to the
house of Cl&#339;lia; and then the sudden resolve to cast
in his lot with the old Jew Ezra, and some of his
people, who were bound for Alexandria, learning that
trade in precious stones and gold was making the fortune
of some of the Jewish race, who were forming a
large colony there.</p>

<p>His father, Severus, cared little what became of
him, and after his mother&#8217;s death and his second
marriage with Junia he had heard but rarely of him.</p>

<p>When he first came to Alexandria, he had to live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
partly by the office of scribe, but by degrees his scholarship
attracted attention, and his quickness in deciphering
old manuscripts, and his acquaintance with many
languages, for which he had a natural gift, was in his
favour. Casca Severus was now held in honour amongst
the literary world of Alexandria, holding a post in
the magnificent library as custodian and secretary,
which had raised him to a position of competence if
not affluence.</p>

<p>Some years before this time, Casca had married
the daughter of a Greek merchant, a beautiful gentle
girl, who though less of a companion to her learned
husband than a joy for her beauty and goodness, was
most dear to him. After some years of waiting a little
daughter was given to them, and from the moment of
her birth the mother drooped and faded before Casca&#8217;s
eyes.</p>

<p>Old Ezra&#8217;s death happened about this time, and
Anna, the Saxon Ebba, returned to serve Casca, and
to take charge of his motherless child. The Greek
name of Hyacintha, which had been given to Casca&#8217;s
sister, was now passed on to his little daughter, and
the name was as a sound of music in Anna&#8217;s ears.</p>

<p>The dreaming over the past in which Casca indulged
that morning was broken in upon by the sound
of footsteps, and one of his servants drew aside the
curtain from the doorway, and admitted a tall soldier-like
man with grizzled beard, and a face bronzed with
exposure, who advanced towards him with outstretched
hands, pronouncing his name&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>&#8220;Casca!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Claudius, is it possible!&#8221; was the almost instant
reply, and then the two men looked at each other
with that curious inquiring gaze with which we scan
the features of those whom we have known in youth,
and meet in later years.</p>

<p>Time had dealt very gently with the scholar and
philosopher. Casca&#8217;s high brow, from which the hair
had retreated, was smooth and but gently marked by
lines. His hands, which had wielded the pen to so
much purpose, were white and slender, and his robe
fell around him in graceful folds.</p>

<p>As he and Claudius stood, with their right hands
clasped together and their left resting on each other&#8217;s
shoulders, they made a fine contrasted picture of the
scholar and the soldier.</p>

<p>Claudius was tall and stalwart, his skin bronzed
with exposure to the sun, several scars of sabre cuts
on his brow and cheek, and many deep wrinkles on
his brow, still shadowed by thick masses of tawny hair
which, like his beard, were lined with silver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Claudius said, &#8220;we meet after many years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you come from Rome?&#8221; Casca asked, &#8220;or
from Verulam?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From Rome,&#8221; and Claudius sighed. &#8220;From Rome,
and I bear you tidings of your sister, now the Vestal
Maxima.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hyacintha!&#8221; exclaimed Casca, &#8220;she is always
dear to my heart, but her life is on the mountain top,
and we poor folk are on a lower level.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>Claudius shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;The mountain top is but a barren waste to her,
I fear. She has much trouble, and her elevation is
dearly bought.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down and tell me all,&#8221; Casca said. &#8220;Ah!
good Claudius, it is like a draught of new wine to see
you. Strange that when you entered I was going over
the past&mdash;the little chamber at Verulam, Hyacintha
sitting by my side, and your loud ringing voice bidding
me meet life as a man, and not as a coward. Brave
advice, whether for the scholar or soldier, eh, good
Claudius?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but methinks, Casca, it is you who must
now cheer me, for my heart is heavy within me, and
I scarce dare to look forward or to look within. You
speak of those far-off days. Do you think I have forgotten
them? Nay, they are written on my heart. I
would that I were a careless fellow again, wrestling in
the games at Verulam, and contented because I knew
of no life greater than the soldier&#8217;s. I am a Christian,
it is true, and ought to rejoice; but, somehow, there is
no rejoicing left in me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I pray you, good Claudius,&#8221; Casca said, &#8220;do not
speak thus. I, too, have had my sorrows. I have lost
my fair young wife, Ianthe, and no grief can be greater
than mine was; but I can rejoice yet in the powers
God has given me, and I live for Him and for our
child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! then, Casca, yours is not a desolate, lonely
life like mine. I think, it is true, of the life beyond,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
and I crave for it with wearying longing; but the beloved
of my soul, your sister Hyacintha, is in bitter
trouble, and I, who would die for her, cannot move,
or stretch forth a finger, to help her.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now, just as Casca was about to ask Claudius
to tell him everything, the sound of little naked feet
pattering on the floor was heard, and the curtain which
separated Casca&#8217;s room from the inner chamber shook,
and from the division in the middle peeped out a
little sunny face, rosy with sleep, with eyes yet dim
from dreams, and coral lips drooping at the corners,
as she caught sight of a strange man in earnest conversation
with her father. Casca rose and held out
his arms, and then there was a sudden rush and a
pair of clinging arms wound round his neck, as
Cynthia buried her golden head on his shoulder and
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Send away that big old man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, nay, my Cynthia, that is not the courtesy I
would fain teach thee,&#8221; said another voice; and turning,
Claudius saw an elderly woman, plainly dressed
in a loose woollen garment, girt around the waist by
a broad belt, and wearing on her head a close cap,
which concealed her hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, my Cynthia,&#8221; she repeated&mdash;and then
Claudius laid his hand on her arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you not know me, Ebba?&#8221;</p>

<p>The great tide of memory swept over poor Anna;
danger, torture, the dungeon, and the death she had
so dreaded, seemed to cover her again with a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
mantle of fear. Her knees trembled, and she would
have fallen forward had not Claudius&#8217;s strong arms
prevented it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Ebba!&#8221; Claudius said, &#8220;do you think you
are in the dungeons again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! pardon me, my noble Claudius! You know
I was ever but a coward, and now that I see you,
my deliverer from death, I have no words to thank
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I need no words, good Ebba. I have lived long
enough now to know that there are worse sorrows than
death, which must pass on all men, to be borne. The
Lord, who is now my Master as well as yours, sent
me to save your life for a good purpose, I will not
doubt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you, too, are a Christian, thanks be to God!&#8221;
Anna exclaimed fervently. &#8220;See there, my Cynthia,
here is the great Claudius who, at the request of thy
beautiful Aunt Hyacintha, my once dear mistress, took
me out of a dark dungeon, and saved my life. Say
&#8216;Good Claudius!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The child, who had raised her wondering face
from her father&#8217;s shoulder, now stretched out her arms
towards the tall warrior, who had at first frightened
her, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Claudius!&#8221; touching his cheeks with her
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;And can you tell me aught of my dear mistress,
the lady Hyacintha?&#8221; Anna asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I have a tale to tell, but it is a sad tale.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>&#8220;Take Cynthia in your arms, and sit down, Anna,&#8221;
said her master. &#8220;You, of all others, ought to hear
the tale, be it sad or joyful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Claudius said, &#8220;there is no reason why you
should be in ignorance of what is in my heart. Nay,
I doubt not you know it already, and that it will, as
regards myself, scarcely be news. From my rough
boyish days at Verulam I have loved your dear mistress,
and I must love her always. Though never to
be mine in this lower world, I may claim her yet
when all earthly taint of sin has passed away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since the death of Terentia Rufilla, the life of
your gracious and beautiful sister has been full of trial,
noble Casca. Bitter jealousy and envy of her acquirements
have been rife in the community. Fair without
these white-robed Vestals may appear, but they not all
are fair within.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the voice of the majority, and by the dying
desire expressed again and again by the late Vestal
Maxima, Terentia Rufilla, Hyacintha Severa was
elected to succeed her. There was none so fitted as
she was; her rank, as the daughter of a noble house,
so high; her accomplishments and graces of mind and
body so rare. But there never was a creature like
her who did not provoke jealousy and ill-will in some
minds. Evil tongues have set afloat rumours concerning
her, which, though at first none heeded, have been
like fertile seed cast here and there, and at last taking
root.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not possible for me to see her. Some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
evil rumours say that she has desired to renounce her
vow, and, becoming a Christian, be free to marry.
Were I to present myself at the Vestals&#8217; atrium it
might fasten the charge of aspiring to her on me, and
add to her trouble. Her rule, as those who know it
well declare, has been marked by its wonderful wisdom.
The young disciples well-nigh worship her, the priests
consult her on every matter connected with the sacred
rites. The one who works the mischief is the daughter
of a princely house, who desires the highest office.</p>

<p>&#8220;Finding all other accusations fail, she now insinuates
that the Vestal Maxima is a Christian in disguise,
and that she merits the death of the faithless
virgin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! may God forbid,&#8221; exclaimed Anna&mdash;&#8220;oh!
may the Lord protect my mistress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; Claudius continued, &#8220;that they will be
saved the trouble of condemning her. The last time
I saw her leading the procession along the Sacred
Way, she looked so wan and ill, and she leaned so
heavily on the shoulder of one of the young priestesses,
and the expression of her beautiful eyes as she turned
them upon me was so mournful that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Claudius stopped; emotion checked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there aught that I can do,&#8221; Casca asked, starting
up; &#8220;aught to relieve the burden which lies upon
my sister! Tell me, Claudius, is there a way to help
her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was to beg you to start for Rome for her solace
and comfort that I journeyed hither,&#8221; Claudius said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>&#8220;I will start willingly,&#8221; Casca exclaimed, &#8220;and
take Anna and my little one with me. Surely the touch
of her sweet kisses, the sound of her merry laughter,
will do much to console my sister! Yes; we will
return together, good Claudius. Shall it be next
month?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, next month may be too late; the journey is
long; set forth without delay, or it may be too late&mdash;too
late,&#8221; he repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will give orders to that effect. You have a
band of your own people here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my galley is manned with a brave band,
and lies in the Port to be ready at any moment. My
ship is fitted with all things needful for her voyage,
and it remains for you to give the word for starting
from this fair city, the fairest that men&#8217;s eyes ever
beheld.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anna, are you ready?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ready at my master&#8217;s word,&#8221; Anna said; &#8220;but
the child, the sweet child, is it safe for her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As safe as man can make it; the voyage in this
fair weather ought to be a pleasurable one; there are
no hardships to fear, good Anna! and I mistake me
if any sea robbers will dare attack the ships manned
by soldiers who have seen service under their commander
in many a battle in the far north, with those
rough Northmen who seem to be ever closing round
the southern folk in increasing numbers and with
added strength. Give but the word, Casca, and we
will start ere the sun sets.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>&#8220;Nay, a week hence,&#8221; was Casca&#8217;s reply. &#8220;I have
to deliver a lecture to-morrow in the south hall of
the museum. I am pledged to expound a hard passage
of a Greek Poet on the day but one after&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have much to do truly,&#8221; said Claudius, impatiently.
&#8220;Of such labours of the brain I know nought;
but this, I say, I believe your sister hungers for a sight
of you, and yearns to clasp your hand in hers. She
cannot speak of her faith, which has slowly risen like
the sun upon her soul, and dispersed the darkness.
She may and does love those around her as her
children, but she cannot talk openly with them, lest
haply they should be condemned and punished with
a punishment even more severe than that which might
fall on her. But delay your departure if you will&mdash;it
is not for a rough soldier like me to enter into the
reasons which a subtle and learned scholar may have
for remaining here. I know what a true heart means,
and I have a strong sword-arm to prove it, but as to
the brain of you philosophers and poets, I know nothing
of it, having, as you will say, but a small share thereof
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, now, good Claudius, do not misjudge me;
do not be angry. We will be ready in the next
week; meantime let us renew our close friendship,
and let me show you the treasures of the past and of
the present, contained within the walls of yonder
stately pile of buildings, which is the museum of the
world!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>Claudius&#8217;s temporary vexation passed away, and
the two friends found themselves knit together by a
hundred subtle ties in the far-off past of their early
life.</p>

<p>Claudius listened with surprise to Casca, as he detailed
all the varied phases of thought through which
he and many hundreds of men had passed in Alexandria.
Casca was a Christian&mdash;that is to say he had
been baptised, and if questioned as to his faith, he
would have given a direct answer that he believed in
the true God and his Son Jesus Christ. But there
could be no doubt that the learning of the schools
had the greatest charm for him, and if he studied the
manuscripts of the Gospels, it was more in a critical
than a faithful spirit.</p>

<p>He considered the writing of St. Luke&#8217;s Gospel so
perfect that he gloried in its study, and he showed
Claudius a beautiful copy inscribed by his own hand,
with notes on the margin, for which he told him he
had won high praise and distinction.</p>

<p>The old heathen worship, he said, was dying, and
the temples were more and more deserted day by
day. But Casca had not embraced the faith of Christ
with the simplicity of a child; it was rather the acceptance
of a finer theory than any he had yet discerned.</p>

<p>That witness within himself, of which Claudius
had spoken to Hyacintha long before, was wanting;
and lost in the mazes of thought, and yielding to the
delight of learning, Casca had missed the humble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
faith in a personal Saviour, which had taught the
brave Claudius self-restraint and self-forgetfulness, and
made him, the valiant hero of a hundred fights,
humble in his own eyes.</p>

<p>Casca showed Claudius the leading features of
interest in Alexandria, and the bustle and activity of
the representatives of many nations filled the Roman
soldier with wonder; for at this time Alexandria, the
greatest sea-port in the world, was crowded with
buyers and sellers, and rich merchant princes from all
quarters.</p>

<p>Through the great Moon Gate there was a perpetual
stream of camels, and elephants, and humble
asses, all laden with merchandise.</p>

<p>Jews were there, with keen eager eyes; Greeks,
with their graceful easy carriage and soft musical
tongue; Romans, too, and representatives of the great
Northern tribes, of which Claudius had spoken.</p>

<p>Rome, the city on the seven hills, had filled the
dreams of his boyhood in Britain; it had been to him
as a queen amongst cities in his later years, but
Alexandria was like a vision.</p>

<p>The ranges of buildings were so vast, and the unbroken
line presented a <i>coup d&#8217;&#339;il</i> of magnificence
scarcely if ever rivalled. Claudius gazed around him,
and but imperfectly heard or understood Casca&#8217;s descriptions
and explanations. He was dazzled and bewildered,
and he could only reply to Casca in monosyllables,
which were scarcely less irritating to Casca
than silence.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>The friends who greeted Casca looked inquiringly
at Claudius, and he felt he had no part or lot in
Alexandria; her beauty was a dead letter to him, and
all her treasures of art and literature sealed books.
While Casca lectured in the museum or attended the
orations of philosophers, Claudius found his chief delight
centred in little Cynthia. She brought back the
old, old days when the other Hyacintha was the child,
and he, a rough untaught boy, felt always softened
and subdued by her presence.</p>

<p>He loved to take the Cynthia of the present on
his knees, and while she toyed with his rough beard,
and the ornaments on his military coat, he would
listen to her babyish prattle, which was made up of
various languages, and find in her society far more
consolation than in the declamations of the orators
and poets in the lecture-rooms of the museum.</p>

<p>Anna was much engaged with her preparations
for departure, and leaving all things in Casca&#8217;s household
in good order. She would look in on the great
soldier sometimes and smile, and bid the child not be
too troublesome, or the good Claudius would weary
of her.</p>

<p>Anna had taught the little Cynthia the Gospel
story, and Claudius found that the Lord, who was
his acknowledged Master, was a very real Being to
Casca&#8217;s little daughter. With the unquestioning faith
of the little child, Cynthia needed no other assurance
than &#8220;Anna says so,&#8221; and Claudius loved to hear her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
tell of the birth of the Lord Jesus, and of the little
babes who were killed for His sake.</p>

<p>Cynthia was scarcely more than four years old, but
she had inherited her father&#8217;s gifts and her mother&#8217;s
Greek grace and delicacy, so that she was wonderfully
forward for her age. She would draw with a
pointed stick, dipped in her father&#8217;s horn, upon the
spare sheets of parchment which lay about, and she
could already form letters, though her great idea was
to &#8220;draw pictures.&#8221;</p>

<p>Claudius would tell her of her aunt, the Vestal
Maxima, at Rome, and that they were going over the
blue sea to see her and comfort her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; Cynthia said, one day; &#8220;I know you
loved that lady, and took Anna out of a dark hole
because you promised. She was shut there because
she loved Jesus the Lord. Do you know Him? Father
never says &#8216;love;&#8217; he says &#8216;worship.&#8217; I don&#8217;t know
what that means!&#8221;</p>

<p>No; little Cynthia knew only of love, nor had
her childish heart grasped as yet the great reality
that love&mdash;perfect love&mdash;is the highest form of worship.
For love must serve, and service is adoration,
and so the circle is complete, and love must be in all
service and in all worship, and both are valueless
without it.</p>

<p>The day for departure came at last, and the finely-equipped
galley in which Claudius had sailed from
Rome turned her helm towards the mouth of the
great canal at Alexandria, and with sails set, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
oars keeping precise time and rhythm, went over
the Lake Mareotis, and thence out into the blue
waters of the tideless sea. The yellow sand-hills of
the desert shone like burnished gold in the evening
light; the multitude of sails stood up against the
carmine sky which melted above the line of the
horizon into the tenderest rose-colour, and again into
the palest colour of the calyx of the daffodil, till it
was lost in the over-arched blue of the summer night.</p>

<p>Stars studded that canopy like eyes of watching
love, and Claudius, seated with his little friend, pressed
close in his strong arms, felt his whole soul filled with
the love of Him who is the Redeemer of the world,
and of <i>him</i>&mdash;wayworn and weary Claudius.</p>

<p>Casca strained his eyes over the lines of a closely-written
manuscript till the light faded, and then Anna
carried away little Cynthia, to the bed prepared for
her, where the murmur of the waves against the sides
of the ship soon lulled her to sleep.</p>

<small>THE CROSS.</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> atrium of the Vestals was full of life, and
even merriment, one bright morning of late summer,
in this same year of 333. The want of sunshine
which was so much felt in the winter, was a gain now
that the fierce glare of August lay upon the streets of
the city, and beat upon the images of the gods and
façades of the temples like a furnace.</p>

<p>The Vestals were chatting gaily with each other
about the grand chariot race for which they had seats
allotted to them. But two were standing a little
apart before a statue which had been placed recently
by the side of Flavia Mamilia, who was the most
famous of the order, and whose statues are multiplied
and the descriptions of her graces and gifts repeated
again and again.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have placed her in good company,&#8221; a tall,
commanding-looking Vestal said, with a little ring of
irony in her voice; &#8220;how long will she remain there,
and what will be the story of her virtues inscribed
below, I marvel! A long one, doubtless&mdash;they will
never get it all into the space allowed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The younger Vestal, a maiden of some twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
summers, who had lately entered upon her fully-consecrated
duties, replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The face is not nearly beautiful enough for our
lady Maxima. Ah me! how soon this stone resemblance
will be all that is left us; she is passing away
from us, I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are some that say the sooner the better;
nay, Hermione, do not start back as if I were saying
some dreadful thing. I repeat, the sooner the better,
for your gracious Hyacintha Severa is acting a part,
and the treachery will be discovered unless death
prevents it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Treachery! nay,&#8221; said Hermione with youthful
fervour; &#8220;nay, our lady is as far removed from
treachery as are the heavens from the earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor child!&#8221; was the provoking rejoinder, &#8220;such
faith as yours must be sweet if it were not misplaced.
I can give you a warning, that certain books have
been discovered in the possession of Hyacintha Severa
which would, in stricter times, have brought the masons
hither to prepare one of those little chambers, whence
no one who entered ever came forth alive. It would
have been inevitable, but now a loose and careless
government has altered things somewhat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot hear you speak thus, C&#339;lia, I cannot.
You hate our noble and beautiful lady because she is
so far, far above you, because&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tush! now, silly little Hermione, I warn you
again, be careful, or who knows if a little chamber
may not be ready for you, and then there will be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Vestal less, and the stones which will prevent your
exit will tell no tales.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hermione was preparing to hurl forth an angry
invective, when a hand was laid on her shoulder:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hermione! nay, do not heed idle threats, but help
me to ascend the staircase; I am expected at the
council of the priests at noon. I have a statement to
make to them which may please you to hear, C&#339;lia
Concordia. You will soon know what that statement
is, and may it ease your heart of the burden of rancour
and unkindness which you cherish towards me. It
must needs be a burden, and I would fain, for your
own sake, that you laid it down. My poor statue shall
not offend you longer; orders shall be given to place
it near the porta, the lowest instead of the highest
place.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke slowly and with difficulty, for her breath
was short, and a little dry gasping cough interrupted
her again and again.</p>

<p>&#8220;You speak in riddles, most gracious lady,&#8221; C&#339;lia
replied; &#8220;I admire the excellence of your statue, and
give the sculptor the highest meed of praise for the
manner in which it is wrought. Flavia Mamilia is
happy to have your near neighbourhood. I must
hasten, as the elder of the company who resort to the
Circus Maximus, to collect my maidens. A chariot
race is a grand thing to witness, but there are many
who find it tame sport in comparison to that of former
times, when Christians were thrown, as they deserved,
to the lions.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>A strong emphasis was laid on the word <i>Christians</i>,
and a glance of hatred from the Vestal&#8217;s dark eyes,
directed at Hyacintha, told its own story, as she made
the usual obeisance to the Vestal Maxima, and went
to the farther end of the atrium.</p>

<p>Hyacintha stood for a few moments leaning heavily
on Hermione&#8217;s arm, and gazing at the marble resemblance
of herself.</p>

<p>A faint smile passed over her face, and she said
in a low voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;They will soon forget me, little Hermione, but
you will ever love me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear lady, we all love you, all but that proud
and haughty C&#339;lia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She will succeed me, as Vestal Maxima,&#8221; Hyacintha
said; &#8220;win her by submission, and do not
irritate her by rebellion. Now let us go.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned for a moment and gazed at the noble
hall with its forest of Corinthian columns, and watched
the white-robed Vestals following C&#339;lia to the porta
on their way to the Circus. Memories of her first
appearance at that door, clinging to Cl&#339;lia&#8217;s hand,
swept over her&mdash;the child of nearly twelve years old,
now the woman of mature age!</p>

<p>&#8220;Thirty years ago,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;thirty years
ago! Ah, little Hermione, I shall soon enter the city
where <i>time</i> is not&mdash;no counting of years there. Come,
let us begin to mount the staircase, slowly, for I have
but little breath in me.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a state room in the upper part of the Vestals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>&#8217;
house the High Priest sat in solemn conclave with his
subordinates, and those who might be called the
Council of the order of Vesta.</p>

<p>It was the custom of the Vestal Maxima to demand
an audience, when she had any especial business to
transact, or any dereliction in duty on the part of the
Vestals to report.</p>

<p>Hyacintha had given notice of her coming, and
when she reached the upper corridor which ran round
the atrium, with pillars corresponding to those below,
she found a guard of honour waiting to escort her into
the presence of the High Priest.</p>

<p>It was usual for the Vestal Maxima to be attended
by two of the elder Vestals on these occasions, but
many had gone to the Circus, and only Hermione was
with her.</p>

<p>To the surprise of the guards, and of Hermione
herself, the Vestal Maxima said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I enter alone.&#8221; Then the curtain was raised, and
Hyacintha Severa passed in.</p>

<p>Great respect was always paid to the Vestal Maxima,
and the assembled priests and those at the table with
them rose, while Hyacintha was conducted to a chair,
into which she sank apparently exhausted. When she
had recovered herself, she asked permission to address
the High Priest from the chair, as her health had
failed, and she could hardly make herself intelligible
if she had to encounter the fatigue of standing while
she spoke.</p>

<p>First she drew from the folds of her pallium a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
parchment on which was inscribed, by her own hand,
all the financial details of the house, and its present
condition. When that had been handed in and laid
on the table, Hyacintha said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I crave permission to resign the office of Vestal
Maxima, and I pray you, most noble father, to consider
the election of my successor. I have but a short
space to live, and I would fain spend that time in the
retirement of my own chamber. The thirty years
which are supposed to limit the service of the Vestals
are over. I entered the atrium, sent hither by my late
noble father Severus, in the year three hundred and
three. My consecration followed in due course, and
then on the death of Terentia Rufilla, of whose noble
house I am a member, I was honoured by your choice
as Vestal Maxima. I have striven to perform my duty
of late in great suffering of body and of mind. I pray,
therefore, to be released therefrom, and that you appoint
a worthy successor to all the duties which have
devolved on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a murmur of dissent amongst those who
sat around, and then one of the Council, fixing a pair
of keen black eyes upon Hyacintha, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;There may be hidden motives why you, Hyacintha
Severa, resign your office. Nay, there <i>are</i> hidden
motives.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the High Priest raised his hand, and said in
a tone of command:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must defer this matter for a season, and we
will ask you to appear before us again at a future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
time. If matters there be that require investigation,
that investigation must be made.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hyacintha rose and seemed about to speak, when
a deadly paleness overspread her face, and she
slipped from the chair in a deep swoon upon the
floor.</p>

<p>The attendants outside were summoned, and Hyacintha
was carried to her own chamber, Hermione
following, where several women who were her especial
servants received her, and she was laid upon her
couch, apparently lifeless. But the usual nostrums and
restoratives had the desired effect, and the Vestal
Maxima revived and looked round on them all with
her sweetest smile.</p>

<p>They piled the cushions up behind her on the
couch, and Hermione fanned her with cool palm
leaves, and, stooping every now and then, kissed her
on the forehead. If Hyacintha had been radiantly
beautiful in youth and early womanhood, she was
beautiful now with a beauty which is not of this world.
Traces of the mental struggle through which she had
passed were seen on her face, it is true; the delicate
flush of youth and health had vanished, but over that
noble countenance there was shed the calm light of
the evening&mdash;the earnest of a coming rest, the sign of
the victory won.</p>

<p>Hermione was left alone with her before long, and
then Hyacintha spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear one,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I shall watch no more in
the temple at night. I shall feed the fire no more. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
am, as C&#339;lia implies, a Christian. Would you like to
know how it has come to pass, my sweet one? I am
stronger now, and I will tell you all before I die.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! sweet lady, dearest mistress!&#8221; Hermione
said, &#8220;you must not die, you cannot die, to go down
to the darksome Hades, to lose the sunlight!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, no! ah, no! my child. I go to <i>life</i>; death
hath no more power to quench that life which Jesus
the Lord has given to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as if that life of which she spoke had already
begun, Hyacintha raised herself on her cushions and
said, with all her old fire and earnestness:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;In that silver coffer, child, are the precious Books&mdash;the
Word of Life. The holy father Eusebius has
from time to time furnished me with those Books.
For many years I <i>could</i> not let the whole beautiful
fabric of my earthly life slip from me. The struggle
between the old faith and the new&mdash;rather between
the false and the true&mdash;has been a fierce one to me.
I have travailed in soul in the temple in the lonely
watches of the night. I have vowed again and again
to the goddess that I would never forsake her. I have
gazed up at her image in the dim light, and besought
her, if she knew me, if she accepted my service, to
give me a sign. But there she has stood, with her veil
flowing behind her, in her long robes, motionless and
calm. What were my tears to her? What were my
agonies of soul? She had never felt them. She had
ears, but she heard not; she had eyes, but she saw
not. And yet, oh Hermione, I verily believe no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
torture of martyrdom could be compared to what I
have suffered for the last six years.</p>

<p>&#8220;While Terentia Rufilla lived, I had not this yearning
of soul after better things. I was not the head
then, only a member of this community, and if she,
noble and gracious as she was, was content, who was
I, to doubt?</p>

<p>&#8220;Once, on the Cælian Hill, on the very morning
of my full consecration, I learned that it was sweet to
be loved. My woman&#8217;s heart told me that this was
the woman&#8217;s highest heritage&mdash;to be the beloved of a
brave, good man. In a vision, as with a lightning
flash, I seemed to see a fair landscape stretched out
before me, where there was the song of rejoicing and
the happiness which comes of a mutual love. Then a
cloud swept over it, blotting it from my sight, and I
was on a mountain top, so high above others&mdash;a
Vestal Virgin, devoted to the service of the goddess;
high above others&mdash;yes, high&mdash;but how cold! how
lonely! Rumours of the wickedness of the city
reached me&mdash;foul deeds, which made me blush for
the women who took part in them. Emperors and
great ones fell; Christians were not exempt from the
love of change; there were dissensions amongst them;
there were envies, and hatreds, and heartburnings
amongst their leaders.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Jew hated and cursed the Christian, and yet
they both believed in the true God. Was it not better
to be safe in these walls, guarded from danger, than
to go forth into the city, whose cry, under the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
of pleasure, was often a bitter cry, than to confess
Christ, and leave the shadow of the cloisters, the safety
of the Temple? If I confessed Christ, I reasoned, and
came forth, how would the finger of scorn have been
pointed at me? how would the unworthiest of motives
have been laid at my door? And then, the cruel
death had I been recaptured, the death which is the
slowest of all deaths to die. I might have escaped,
for a word was enough to him of whom I speak, but
the motive was mixed, and of the earth: and I
trampled down the longing and went on my way. Dost
thou remember how, when a little child, they brought
thee weeping to Terentia? I held out my arms to
thee, and thou didst nestle in them. Ah! dear one,
do not weep. Thy love has been my solace many a
time.&#8221; For Hermione had flung herself on her knees
by Hyacintha&#8217;s couch, and was weeping wildly and
passionately.</p>

<p>She soothed her as a mother soothes a child, and
then she said, with a weary sigh:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has been a long fight, and a bitter struggle,
but it is over now, and the Lord Jesus has shown me
Himself, the Crucified One on the Cross, and that by
the Cross alone we may win our Crown. I have committed
to my memory, which has ever been a good
one, large portions of the Gospels in the soft Greek
tongue, and the words have been as honey and the
honey-comb. The good father Eusebius baptised me
yestere&#8217;en in the name of the Lord, and nothing now
remains but to commit my soul to Him who died for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
me, and for thee, also, sweet Hermione, and for the
whole world.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was silent for a time, and Hermione thought
she slept, but presently she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;My brother Casca, Claudius, good, faithful Ebba,
I shall see them soon! Hermione, in a few short
years this temple will be deserted, the company of
Vestals will be broken up, for the Sun has risen far
above the horizon, and He has called the nations into
His marvellous light.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she wandered on, no longer of the present,
but of the past. The cruel death of Alban, which
was prominent in her childish dreams, the departure
of Ebba, the vow Claudius had sworn. &#8220;Good Claudius,&#8221;
she repeated, &#8220;good Claudius; and he kept that
vow. Ah! yes; good, brave Claudius!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hermione and her devoted servants watched over
her that night, and her strength rapidly declined.</p>

<p>There was almost universal sorrow shown when it
became known that the Vestal Maxima was dying.</p>

<p>All the great Roman families sent representatives
to the Vestals&#8217; House to inquire as to her condition.</p>

<p>The young children, the lately-received disciples,
were in tears; the newly-consecrated Vestals went sorrowfully
about their work, striving to perform their
duties for the sake of her, who would never again
give them the benefit of her counsel and advice.</p>

<p>The whole community passed in one by one to
bid her a farewell.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>She smiled on them as they knelt by her side, and
murmured words which were hardly intelligible.</p>

<p>C&#339;lia Concordia came last.</p>

<p>She dreaded the interview, and would fain have
avoided it; but Hyacintha asked for her again and
again.</p>

<p>Proudly and haughtily she stood by the couch of
the dying Vestal. Her dark eyes looked down on the
beautiful face before her, without a shadow of tenderness
or sympathy in them.</p>

<p>Hyacintha smiled, and said to Hermione:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell her to stoop down; I want to say something
to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>C&#339;lia obeyed, unwillingly enough, and to her surprise
she caught the words:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;May the God whom I love in Christ fill you with
peace. With my last breath I pray Him for your conversion.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the proud Vestal, wrapt in the impenetrable
mantle of her own self-assertion and self-exaltation,
did not respond. She turned away, whispering to herself:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true, then, she <i>is</i> a Christian!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, so greatly was Hyacintha Severa
honoured, that the Council, who met the day after she
had appeared before them, handed over to the sculptor
the inscription for the pedestal on which her statue
stood, with its high praise of her virtues and her services.</p>

<p>She had failed in no duty; nothing but good was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
spoken of her by any of her companions, with two
exceptions, of whom C&#339;lia Concordia was one, and
the priest who had hinted at hidden motives, that
might have brought about the resignation of the Vestal
Maxima, another.</p>

<p>A resolution was carried by a majority in the
Council that it was not needful to enter into these
motives. Besides, at the close of thirty years&#8217; devotion
to the service of the temple, by an old statute,
the priestesses were free to depart if so they desired.
Very few lived to avail themselves of the freedom
which was thus granted to them. And those who did
survive had become so accustomed to the routine of
the Vestals&#8217; House that they showed no anxiety to
leave its shelter in their declining years.</p>

<p>The privileges, too, of the Vestals were very
highly prized, and of late years their table had been
luxuriously appointed, and their life had been one of
ease and refinement, so that the change to a more
ordinary manner of living would have been far from
acceptable to many who had severed the ties of earlier
years, and who would have found themselves adrift
in the great city, outside the walls of the Vestals&#8217;
House.</p>

<small>THE CROWN OF LIGHT.</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the dawn of the third day when Hermione
was awoke from a light slumber by Hyacintha&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;The watch is nearly over,&#8221; she said; &#8220;the day
is near. I have been in the temple all night; how
came I hither?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, dearest lady,&#8221; Hermione said; &#8220;you have
been sleeping on your couch, and I have watched&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I had been in the temple, and I saw
there my brother and Ebba, and myself a little child
again. There was a sudden great light, and it shone
on them&mdash;and Claudius, good Claudius!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hermione thought she was wandering a little, and
beckoned to one of the attendants to bring her a reviving
draught.</p>

<p>The Vestal Maxima smiled, saying, &#8220;I saw them,
and I followed them up a golden stair to the place
where the stars were shining. Casca was reading
from a book the words of Socrates: &#8216;The soul is most
certainly immortal, and cannot perish; it will exist
in the unseen world, taking nothing with it but the
discipline it has gained here.&#8217; I know the words well,
and I cannot be mistaken. They were spoken by my
brother&#8217;s voice&mdash;Casca&#8217;s voice. Whether it were a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
vision I know not, or a reality I cannot tell, but there
is in me a certainty that Casca is near.&#8221;</p>

<p>It not unfrequently happens that the spiritual
perceptions of those who are nearing the unseen world
are quickened. However that may be, Hermione was
startled a few hours later by a hasty summons to the
atrium, where she was told some strangers were inquiring
for the Vestal Maxima.</p>

<p>A pale ethereal looking man, in a long scholar&#8217;s
robe, was holding a lovely child of five or six years
old by the hand, around whom an admiring group of
white-robed Vestals clustered.</p>

<p>Behind stood a plainly-dressed, elderly woman,
and a man in the full accoutrements of a Roman
officer by her side.</p>

<p>Hermione recognised the officer. She had seen
him often, for whenever the Vestals were in public,
that tall stalwart figure was always hovering near; and
once or twice in the early part of this year Hyacintha
had referred to him as a friend of her childhood&#8217;s
days in Verulam.</p>

<p>Claudius had, indeed, watched her from a distance,
never offending her by approaching her, loving
her with that purest of all loves, the love which can
sacrifice everything for the one beloved.</p>

<p>Claudius had noted the gradual decay of Hyacintha&#8217;s
strength, and reading her aright, he had, as
we know, hastened to Alexandria, to bring, if possible,
the brother whom she had so dearly loved to
her side.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>Casca now approached Hermione.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Casca Severus,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the brother of
the Vestal Maxima, Hyacintha Severa. Can I see
her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She lies at the point of death,&#8221; Hermione answered,
with a short quick sob. &#8220;She is leaving us&mdash;and,
ah! whither is she going?&#8221;</p>

<p>Casca did not reply, but little Cynthia, looking
up at the Vestal with her clear wondering eyes,
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is going to God. Anna says that dead
people are only gone to God.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hermione stooped, and raising the child in her
arms, motioned to Casca to follow her. Anna&#8217;s wistful
face seemed to ask that she might also come, but
Claudius turned away, and going to the porta, stood
leaning against the stone columns which supported it,
where the lictors in charge of the Vestals for that
morning, coming and going, also stood with quiet unmoved
faces, as if carved in marble like the statues
behind them.</p>

<p>Presently a man, with an attendant, who bore a
basket of sharp tools, came up. They passed Claudius,
and he saw them go towards a statue.</p>

<p>Then the workman&#8217;s sharp-pointed tools were
examined, and a scroll of parchment laid out on the
ground.</p>

<p>With easy grace the sculptor threw himself down
at the feet of the statue, and began to carve the inscription.
Claudius watched him like one in a dream.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
There was no need to tell him who that noble and
majestic statue represented. He turned and went a
few steps further into the interior of the atrium, and
saw the sharp point of the tool in the skilful hands of
the sculptor, carving the words.</p>

<p>They were words of praise, which have, after centuries
of obscurity, been lately brought to light. Every
stroke of the chisel, every turn of the well-skilled
wrist, was watched by the brave soldier, who stood
leaning against one of the beautiful pillars.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ob meritum castitatis pudicitiæ atque in sacris
religionibusque doctrinæ mirabilis, Hyacinthæ Severæ
Virgini Vestali Maximæ.&#8221;</p>

<p>That name, which had been for so many years
enshrined in the brave soldier&#8217;s heart, was just traced
on the stone, when a group of Vestals came fluttering
towards the place.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Vestal Maxima is departing,&#8221; an old Vestal
said, touching Claudius&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;Hermione bids
me conduct you to her chamber, where her brother
and her servant have watched for the last hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Claudius stood rooted to the spot. He had
feared his presence might disturb the last hours of
one he loved too well, to make his own wishes of
any moment. He bowed and shook his head, but
remained standing, watching the work of the chisel,
while every letter seemed engraved in his heart.</p>

<p>Presently another messenger came&mdash;Hermione.</p>

<p>&#8220;She asks for you,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;come!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Claudius drew himself up to his full height,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
as if he were about to face some advancing host, and
with head erect, and hands clasped tightly together,
he followed Hermione, without uttering a word.</p>

<p>As they passed along the corridor of the upper
storey, they met C&#339;lia Concordia. Hermione made
the customary token of respect to the superior Vestals
from those who were beneath them, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;We go to see the Vestal Maxima, who is departing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Vestal Maxima has departed already,&#8221; was
the cold and haughty answer. &#8220;I have just returned
from the Council, where I have been chosen as her
successor in the office she quitted three days ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hermione&#8217;s dark southern eyes flashed through
the mists of tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;The beloved lady Hyacintha, beloved of all the
priestesses, is dying,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and leaves no equal
behind; her name will live. It is even now inscribed
upon the pedestal of her statue, beneath the words
which, by the common consent of the whole Council,
were written on a scroll for the sculptor, and despatched
to him yester-even.&#8221;</p>

<p>C&#339;lia passed on, saying in a low voice, words of
which Hermione failed to catch the meaning, but
which were&mdash;&#8220;<i>her name shall perish</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hyacintha lay upon the cushions of her couch,
with closed eyes; over her features peace brooded.</p>

<p>The conflict and the struggle were over, and she
was only awaiting the summons.</p>

<p>Suddenly, with one of the flashes of consciousness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
which are like the leaping up of the flame before it
dies out she opened her eyes and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see the golden stairs which lead upward to the
stars: Claudius, good Claudius&mdash;Claudius!&#8221;</p>

<p>The brave soldier drew a step nearer, and in low
husky tones, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am here, Hyacintha, I am here!&#8221;</p>

<p>A bright smile passed over her face as she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have found the true Light, Claudius, the Dayspring
from on high. I am going where the Light
shall never be put out, and you will come, good
Claudius&mdash;promise, vow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will come, God helping me,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;beloved,
I will come.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the brightness faded from her face; she became
confused, and said in distress, that she had
slept, and that the sacred fire was extinguished. Then,
with a cry, &#8220;The Light! The Light can never be put
out.&#8221; She extended her arms as if to greet one who
was coming towards her, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see Him&mdash;He is the true Light, Jesus the
Lord!&#8221;</p>

<p>And so her spirit departed, and Hyacintha Severa
entered into the full shining of the true Light which
lighteth every man who cometh into this sad and weary
world.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the sacred Pom&#339;rium, the space marked out
by religious rites along the line of the old wall&mdash;the
ashes of Hyacintha Severa were laid.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>The High Priest and Council, touched by her loss,
refused to acknowledge publicly that she was a
Christian. Loved and honoured in her life by many
without, as well as by many within the walls of the
Vestals&#8217; House, the old High Priest silenced the
accusers, and carried the point that the late Vestal
Maxima should be honoured in her death, as she had
been loved in her life.</p>

<p>For the old priest knew that the old faith was
vanishing away; knew that the Christians were multiplying
daily; knew that even in that community the
seed had been sown, which might bring forth fruit,
and that Hyacintha would not be the only Christian
amongst their numbers.</p>

<p>This was no time for suppression by violence or
by force; the supporters of the old faith made the
lives of the Vestals more and more luxurious, increased
their privileges, and the last thirty or forty
years of their existence were to all outward seeming
their best years.</p>

<p>But the faith in the goddess Vesta and the sacred
fire which her priestesses were vowed to keep a pure
and inextinguishable flame, was even now rotten at
its heart. What had once been received with childlike
earnestness and simplicity of belief, was now but
a hollow profession, and the old faith was dying.</p>

<p>C&#339;lia Concordia held the supreme office of Vestal
Maxima for many years. She was a woman of keen
intellect, and a great friend, we are told, of the
famous champion of Polytheism, Vettius Agorius Prætextatus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Her statue was set up in the house of that
nobleman, and he received the unwonted honour of
having his raised in the Vestals&#8217; atrium.</p>

<p>A powerful, vigorous woman, C&#339;lia Concordia
carried things with a high hand. The little children,
timid and tearful in the first few weeks of their discipleship,
did not come to her with their sorrows. The
maidens confided in her none of their hopes and
fears. C&#339;lia loved the power the office gave her too
well to resign it. Strong in body as in mind, she saw
her old companions pass away, the children fade and
die, the maidens droop and lose their fresh bloom;
and she persecuted by a thousand little acts of tyranny
two or three whom she suspected of having embraced
the Christian faith; and Hermione was one who felt
the full bitterness of her satire, and often quailed
beneath it.</p>

<small>ONWARD AND UPWARD.</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Claudius turned away from the Vestals&#8217;
home on the day of Hyacintha&#8217;s death, there was in
his noble heart only one longing&mdash;to follow her whither
she was gone.</p>

<p>Casca and little Cynthia were his guests, with the
faithful Anna; and when Casca spoke of returning to
Alexandria, Claudius begged him to delay. It seemed
to Claudius like a second parting from the love of his
whole life to lose the child who bore her name, and
who returned the devotion of the old soldier with a
childish affection which was inexpressibly sweet to him.</p>

<p>But Casca was anxious to return to Alexandria,
where now he had made his home. Rome had lost
its charm for him; there were few left to sympathise
with him in his learned researches, and the great
Museum of Alexandria, with its inexhaustible treasury
of literature and art, had no rival in Rome.</p>

<p>To linger about the place where Hyacintha had
lived, to recall her in all the long years of faithful and
pure devotion which he had lavished upon her&mdash;this
was the comfort of Claudius&#8217;s heart, but, naturally,
with Casca it was wholly different.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>He had loved her as a brother, and had retained
his affection for her in the long years of separation,
thinking tenderly of her as his little sister in the old
home at Verulam, when she cheered him in the struggles
which his early boyhood had known, in the consciousness
of physical weakness, and the inward conviction
that he had the mental power which, if it were
but allowed scope, would stand him in far better stead
than the sword and the battle-axe.</p>

<p>But he had made new ties, and gathered round
him the joys of home. While his young wife lived he
had been happy in the present; and the past, which
was all to his friend Claudius, was to him like a pleasant
but fading dream.</p>

<p>Then, when his wife was taken from him, his
pride and joy centred in his child, who seemed, even
at this early age, to inherit the beauty and graces of
her aunt in no scant measure.</p>

<p>It is always hard to those who are growing old to
feel that while others of their friends and contemporaries
have gathered round them interests and the
sweet ties of home-life, they are standing, like the last
of some old forest trees, companionless and alone.</p>

<p>Claudius had been a brave soldier, and was considered
a distinguished officer, who had earned his
laurels on many a bloodstained field. But his brethren
in arms, who gave themselves up, on their retirement
from active service, to all the luxuries and often
license of Roman society, found him but a dull and
speechless companion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>Gradually Claudius withdrew more and more from
public life; and now what had been the one great
interest of his daily routine at Rome was over!</p>

<p>To watch the Vestal Maxima at a distance, to
divine her every look and gesture, to be present at all
public ceremonials where she was to be seen, to be
the presiding genius of her life, though never to approach
her or give her cause for uneasiness&mdash;this had
been Claudius&#8217;s mission. He had heard of the evil
rumours which C&#339;lia had tried to sow broadcast; he
had watched the once stately step growing more feeble,
the deep earnest eyes lose their intense glow, the beautifully-chiselled
features grow more pinched and wan,
and his heart had sunk within him.</p>

<p>He had held much counsel with the good Father
Eusebius, and knew that the Christian faith which he
held dear had taken deep root in Hyacintha&#8217;s heart.
And this had been at once the consolation and the
fear of his life of late. Consolation, for he knew well
what was the support of the Faith of Christ; fear, lest
the sharp eyes which were directed towards the Vestal
Maxima should scent out the truth, and that she should
be given up by her accusers to disgrace.</p>

<p>This had been assisted by Hyacintha&#8217;s resignation
at the time when such resignation was allowed, and
the love which she had awakened in the hearts of the
many had triumphed over the maliciousness of the few.</p>

<p>Anna was old now, and her strength did not hold
out for the long walks in which little Cynthia at six
years old delighted. So it fell to Claudius to drive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
her in his chariot, or take her hand in his and lead
her along the Appian Way, telling her stories of the
old heroes, as Cl&#339;lia had told them to Hyacintha and
Casca long ago. But their favourite walk was to the
Cælian Hill, and there sometimes they would meet
Hermione on her way to the spring, when, dismissing
the attendants who followed the Roman soldier and
the fair child at a distance, they would sit and speak
of the Vestal Maxima, and Hermione would fondle the
little Cynthia, and say to Claudius &#8220;that she, too,
might have been a Vestal, so beautiful she was, and
so full of wit and cleverness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, no! the child has another and a higher mission
than that of the Vestal virgin. She will be the
joy and glory of some good man&#8217;s home, so I pray the
good Father of us all, who loves the little children.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who loves the little children,&#8221; Cynthia repeated,
as she leaned against Claudius&#8217;s knee, her hands full
of violets and anemones which empurpled the hill&#8217;s
side. &#8220;When I am a woman I shall tell every one
about the Lord, who was a little child Himself on
earth, and loved the children who came near Him,
just as I come near you, Claudius. Hermione, don&#8217;t
you love Him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Hermione&#8217;s eyes filled with tears. She had
not the courage to confess the Faith openly, which
would needs draw upon her instant dismissal from her
office, and end in imprisonment, and perhaps death.
She was suspected, and jealously watched, by the
Vestal Maxima; and nothing but the noble family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
from which she came, and the rich gifts which they
constantly showered upon the temple of the goddess,
could have saved her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you love Him, Hermione? My aunt loved
Him. Anna loves Him, and so does good Claudius.
Father adores Him; he does not say he loves Him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hermione turned away her face. She was like
thousands in those days of persecution, struggling out
of the shadows into the light; scarcely prepared to
give up all for Christ, and yet yearning after Him with
that tender yearning which is the aspiration of the
soul for One who, though unseen, it loves.</p>

<p>Shall we not think of such in every age with sympathy
and pity? Shall we not leave them in the loving
hands of Him who knoweth our infirmities, and
remembers that we are but dust?</p>

<p>Hermione quickly rallied herself, and said, &#8220;My
time of leave is over. I must be hastening home, or
the lictors at the gate will be impatient. When do you
depart for Alexandria, good Claudius?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, I know not whether I depart at all; but
Casca and the child, and their attendants, are sailing
from the Portus Augusti next week.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hermione took Cynthia from Claudius for a moment,
and said, &#8220;Listen, Cynthia; you must not forget
me, for I loved your aunt, and she loved me. You will
write to me as soon as you are able to wield the pen,
and you will tell me of all you learn, and all you do
in Alexandria. And do not forget poor Hermione.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cynthia clasped the Vestal round the neck, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
said, &#8220;Come with us to our pretty home in Alexandria.
Why cannot you come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am tied and fettered here,&#8221; said poor Hermione;
&#8220;and here I must live till death comes to me and
frees me from bondage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said the child, &#8220;I am glad I am not to be
a Vestal, but that I belong to the Lord Jesus&mdash;so
glad!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hermione kissed the child fervently, and then
turned away, waving her hands in token of farewell,
saying, &#8220;Remember your promise, little Cynthia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What has she asked of thee, little one?&#8221; Claudius
said, when the child had returned to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;She bade me write to her, and never forget her,&#8221;
Cynthia said. &#8220;I shall make haste to learn to write;
and father says already I am a little scholar. You
will help me to write, good Claudius.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, then, little one, this hand of mine is not
skilled in using the pen or scribbling in parchment;
but there are many others who will teach thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are going to Alexandria with us? You will
not leave us, good Claudius?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, we will not speak of parting yet&mdash;not yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Never!</i>&#8221; exclaimed Cynthia, emphatically; &#8220;never!&#8221;
And Claudius evaded a direct answer, but promised
that he would at least take care of her on the coming
return voyage, for the season was late, and they would
probably meet with storms in the inland sea through
which they must sail to the fair city of Alexandria.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>Claudius found the attractions at Alexandria,
where he shared the home of Casca and his little
daughter, too great to be withstood. He vibrated, it
is true, between the two cities for a year or two, but
as age sapped his strength, and brought low the once
athletic and vigorous frame, he became less inclined
for action, and was content to live the quiet life in
which his friend Casca delighted, and to enjoy with
him the society of the little daughter who, as she grew
in years, grew in all the graces and attractions which
had distinguished the aunt whose name she bore, and
whom she so strongly resembled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Claudius,&#8221; the commander of many brave
troops of soldiers, the noble, valiant, and courageous
warrior, became in his old age gentle and subdued;
but his deeds of valour had not died out of the remembrance
of some who had shared in them; and in
his retirement at Alexandria he was sometimes visited
by those who had some connection with him as a
leader or companion in arms.</p>

<p>One day, when Cynthia was about fifteen, eight or
nine years after the voyage to Rome and the death
of the Vestal Maxima, Claudius was walking slowly
and feebly along the smooth walks of the Museum
gardens, waiting for Cynthia to return from one of
the academies, where, attended by one of her maids,
she studied with several young maidens, under a lady
who lectured upon the Greek poets and the Greek
authors of a bygone time.</p>

<p>Casca&#8217;s anxious desire that his only child should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
be distinguished for accomplishments of every kind,
and have her mental gifts cultivated to the utmost,
was not likely to be disappointed.</p>

<p>Cynthia was already known as one of the most
promising of Zoe&#8217;s pupils, and she seemed to have no
difficulty in acquiring and retaining knowledge.</p>

<p>On this lovely spring morning, Claudius, being a
little weary, seating himself on a bench near one of the
principal fountains, which made a soft musical murmur
as the waters fell into a deep marble basin, turned
suddenly as he heard his name.</p>

<p>A man about his own age, leaning on the arm of
a youth of eighteen or twenty, advanced towards him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I see before me Claudius, who
commanded the fourth legion under Constantius?&#8221;</p>

<p>The two old men stood facing each other silently
for a few moments, and then grasped each other&#8217;s
hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never expected to meet you, brave Claudius,
again, least of all at Alexandria.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I, my noble friend and old ally, Varrus,
never expected to grasp your hand in mine again.
Methought you lived at Marseilles?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, and I have left it only for a short space, to
bring hither to this seat of learning my only son,
Heraclitus, who craved for the schools of wisdom
here, and desires to add the learning of the scholar to
the courage of the soldier. And here, my son,&#8221; he
continued, &#8220;is as brave a soldier as ever wielded a
sword, the good and valiant Claudius.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>&#8220;It seems that I see your father again in you,&#8221;
Claudius said. &#8220;Varrus, you live again in your boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! and I have two fair daughters, whom I have
left with their mother at Marseilles; and here, if I
mistake not, comes one of yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>For at that moment, speeding towards the place
where Claudius sat, came the graceful figure of a
young girl, dressed in pure white silk, her over-mantle
of pale greenish-blue, and a handkerchief embroidered
with gold, in the familiar pattern we call the &#8220;key
pattern,&#8221; thrown over her sunny head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, I have no ties of home, Varrus; I never
married. She who is coming towards us is as dear as
any daughter. Why does she tarry?&#8221;</p>

<p>For Cynthia had suddenly stopped, and, throwing
her large crimson satchel to her maid, she skirted the
marble basin of the fountain with swift steps.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see! I see!&#8221; exclaimed the young man; &#8220;a
little child is dangerously near the brink of the fountain&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He said no more, but sprang across the emerald
turf to the edge of the deep marble basin, where the
clear waters were gently rocking on their breast the
broad leaves of the water-lily, already showing their
snowy heads from the thick green calyx.</p>

<p>But the waters suddenly became disturbed by
something more than the gentle fall of the jets of the
fountain. They were swollen into little wavelets, and
as the two elder men reached the spot they heard a
cry, and saw Heraclitus plunge into the basin, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
was some six feet in depth, and some two hundred
feet in circumference.</p>

<p>&#8220;My mistress plunged in to save a child who had
fallen into the water,&#8221; exclaimed Cynthia&#8217;s attendant.
&#8220;Ah me! Ah me! Will she be drowned?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the girl, after the fashion of such maidens
in every time, uttered a long and piercing shriek,
which brought to the spot a good many of those who
were wandering about in the Museum gardens on this
early spring morning.</p>

<p>Claudius&#8217;s face was blanched with horror, and he
clutched the arm of his friend Varrus for support.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be of good courage,&#8221; Varrus said; &#8220;my son has
rescued both the child and the maiden. See! they
are already safe!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear Claudius,&#8221; Cynthia struggled to say,
as, breathlessly, and her clothes heavy with water,
Claudius bent anxiously over her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, safe; and the little child&mdash;is he safe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks to your noble efforts, fair lady,&#8221; Heraclitus
said, &#8220;no harm is done. Hearken!&#8221; And a loud
scream from the little boy, as his mother, who carelessly
allowed him to stray too near the edge of the
fountain, clasped him frantically to her breast, testified
to the truth of the young man&#8217;s words.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all well, then. Nay, good Claudius, do not
be frightened. I will go home now, and change my
wet garments. Ah! look at my poor handkerchief;
see, the gold border is spoiled.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>She said this with childlike earnestness, and then,
helped to her feet by Varrus, she said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is my father, Casca, to thank for coming to
my rescue? You, too, brave sir, will need change of
garments. Claudius, do bid my deliverer to come to
our house.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cynthia was fighting against a feeling of faintness
and exhaustion which the sudden plunge into the
water had caused; and Heraclitus was quite forgetting
his own share in the rescue of the child, in the admiration
he felt for the beautiful maiden who had so
promptly gone to save the child&#8217;s life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come home with us,&#8221; Claudius said, in a tremulous
voice; &#8220;come home, and let my friend Casca
and me show our gratitude. Our greatest treasure has
been in peril, and we owe her preservation to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mother of the little boy, less grateful than she
might have been, hastened away with her struggling,
screaming son, and very soon the voice of the fountain,
which had for the time been lost in the tumult, was
again heard, and the gentle motion of the clear waters
rocked the budding lilies on its breast undisturbed, as
before.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some months later a letter from Cynthia to
Hermione, written with a finely-pointed quill on
smooth parchment, was delivered by a messenger at
the House of the Vestals at Rome&mdash;for Cynthia had
never forgotten her promise, and her letters, at first
mere scrawled hieroglyphics, had been the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
events in her sad life; for Hermione lived in the
shadow, tolerated simply because of her rank and
wealth, but looked upon, as I have said, with suspicion
and dislike by the proud Vestal Maxima, C&#339;lia Concordia;
and all those who wished to win favour with
her kept aloof from Hermione.</p>

<p>How many sad and disappointed lives, bound by
the fetters of an enforced vow, have been hidden
alike in the House of the Vestals, and later in the
monasteries of mediæval times!</p>

<p>Of all pathetic cries which ascend to the Throne
of the Father of us all is the cry of the woman who,
mistaking her true vocation as a helper and consoler,
has chafed like a bird against its prison bars, to obtain
the liberty which alone gives the zest to service.
Hermione had, indeed, ceased to struggle against her
fate, and a cold and numb despair had destroyed her
beauty, and made her a prematurely old woman.
Her eyes were too dim to read Cynthia&#8217;s letter in the
shadows of the atrium, and she hid it in her robe,
and took it with her to the familiar spot on the Cælian
Hill, where she had so often come as a young maiden
with Hyacintha Severa, and had watched over the
lovely child who had inherited her grace and wonderful
gifts of mind and person.</p>

<p>&#8220;From the Museum Street of the city Alexandria,
Cynthia, the daughter of Casca Severus, greets
with affection Hermione, a Vestal virgin, in the House
of the Vestals at Rome.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I wrote to you last, dear friend, I was but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
a child; and now, though but eighteen months have
passed away, I am no longer &#8216;little Cynthia,&#8217; but a
woman. Ah! dear Hermione, it is a beautiful gift of
God&mdash;our God&mdash;this heritage of woman. I am as one
who has been toying with flowers in the valley, contented
with the flowers, and thinking of nothing above
them, and then suddenly lifted on a mountain top,
whence there lies stretched out a lovely landscape,
and a voice tells me it is mine, that I reign over it,
and that the blue arch of heaven above me encircles
me with love. Yes, Hermione, as by a miracle your
little Cynthia has forgotten her childish days, and has
come into possession of her inheritance as a woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I would fain tell you of all that has happened
since eighteen months ago, when I last wrote
to you. It has been a long, long pause, but I will
make up for it now. I will take time, and write fully
the story of this wondrous change.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a bright spring morning, and I was returning
from the lecture room at the Museum, through
the gardens, when, just as I was hastening to join
good old Claudius on a bench where he rested, I saw
a little child balancing himself on the slippery edge
of the wide basin of the central fountain.</p>

<p>&#8220;In another instant he was in the water; and what
could I do, as no one else was near, but plunge in
and seize the boy by his little toga.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I had neared good Claudius I had noticed
he was not alone, but that two men were apparently
talking to him. It was one of these, Heraclitus, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
sprang forward, and had soon brought from under the
crystal water myself and the child.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Hermione! as that noble face bent over me,
and I gazed up at it, I felt at once that thrill which is
half-awe, half-joy, like that foreshadowing of the break
of day, which makes the little bird stir in its nest&mdash;for
though as yet nothing is clear, and nothing defined,
the <i>day is near</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;The day was dawning at that moment; the day
of love which has been so beautiful and fair ever since.
Nor can night cast any shadow over that day of love,
with its dark mantle, for my love stretches forward to
that city fairer than Alexandria, fairer than Rome,
where there is <i>no night</i> and no darkness at all, for
God is the Light.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must, however, go on with my narrative of
events. The youth who snatched me from the water,
and laid me on the turf with the child, is named
Heraclitus. His father was a friend and companion
in arms of dear Claudius, and he had come from Marseilles
to seek education and advantages here in
Alexandria for his only son.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may be sure, Hermione, that my father,
Casca, bade both father and son a warm welcome,
and from the first there seemed a bond between us all.
When the father of Heraclitus returned to Marseilles,
Heraclitus was left with my father and good Claudius.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heraclitus showed from the first the greatest
powers of mind and body, and from the very first he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
seemed to account it his greatest happiness to be with
us. Ah, Hermione! with <i>me</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Soon that gentle thrill of awakening in my heart
grew stronger. Soon I knew that I was loved as my
father Casca had loved my fair mother, Ianthe, as
Claudius had loved my beautiful aunt Hyacintha.</p>

<p>&#8220;The cup of bliss seemed full to overflowing,
when there came a drop of exceeding bitterness to
spoil the sweetness. Good old Claudius, in passing
down the long flight of steps from the Museum, fell
heavily, and it was with difficulty that Heraclitus
brought him home.</p>

<p>&#8220;For many weeks he lay helpless and uncomplaining.
Sometimes he would say, &#8216;It was a strange
end for a soldier, to lie on soft cushions, and be tended
by women&#8217;s hands.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;We did tend him carefully, and cheered his last
days with the warmth of a love we might well bear
one who had been so closely bound up in life with my
father Casca and my aunt the Vestal Maxima.</p>

<p>&#8220;Claudius spoke much of the past, but little of
the present. The farther off the scene, the clearer the
vision. My father, always absorbed in his manuscript,
would sometimes raise his head and smile, as Claudius
spoke of Verulam, and the small upper chamber
there and little Hyacintha and her hair shining under
the light of the silver lamp which hung from the
roof. Then of Ebba and her conversion to the faith
of the Christian; his own vehement and angry persecution
of the Christians, and of the dark dungeon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
into which he entered, bearing the dead Jewish girl
in his arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;All this was clear before him, but of the later
days at Rome he said little, and that little was confused.
He loved to hear me read the Gospels, and the
vision of the great Apostle of Love at Patmos, I would
repeat again and again. He spoke to me of Heraclitus,
and said he was worthy of my love, if my father
consented, but father, dear father, held back a little.
He seemed unable to give me up, even to Heraclitus.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was almost the last words that passed dear
Claudius&#8217;s lips&mdash;&#8216;Give Hyacintha to the young Heraclitus&#8217;&mdash;for
when he lay dying, Claudius ever called me
by my full name. He would gaze at me with dreamy
eyes, and said, though I was so high above him he
loved me still.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was thinking of the other Hyacintha, no
doubt.</p>

<p>&#8220;He departed in peace; and then, within a month,
dear Anna followed him. Ah, Hermione! she died in
the Faith, and she has left behind her the memory of
true service, which will never pass away.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father said no word on the subject nearest
my heart. And Heraclitus, brave and true, and noble,
said he would not press an old man unduly, for there
was time before us; we were both so young.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it happened one day that another suitor
came to my father, and asked his leave to marry me.
I hated this man, though he is one of the richest in
all Alexandria. My father put him off with the excuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
that he could not spare me, and that I was very
young, but he did not acknowledge what was indeed
the truth, that in my secret heart I was bound to
Heraclitus.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father, ever quiet, and gentle, and courteous,
can scarcely think of others as less so than himself,
and he was perhaps not sufficiently firm in his refusal.
Be that as it may, I was walking with my attendant,
Portia, in the Museum gardens one evening, with a
book in my hand, when this hateful man accosted me.
He said at first all manner of smooth and flattering
things, and then when I turned away, he grew angry,
and seized my arm. I was frightened, and struggling
to get away, called for help. Help was near. With
one blow Heraclitus had felled the man to the ground,
and, leaving him there, bore me in his arms to my
father.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Give her to me,&#8217; he exclaimed. &#8216;Give me the
right to protect her from all insult henceforth.&#8217; And
so it was settled. And my dear father made preparations
for our marriage, and we live with him in such
happiness as I can never tell.</p>

<p>&#8220;It cannot but happen that living as I do with
such scholars as my father and my husband, I should
become well versed in the literature of the schools. I
love to hear those who are so full of learning discourse.
We have a large house now, and many frequent
it. I am the mistress of it, and I have to fulfil
its duties. Ah, Hermione! why am I so blessed by
God? What have I done to merit His goodness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
thus shown to me? It makes me sad at times, to
think of you, in your dark, dim, shadowy life, in the
old Vestals&#8217; House. That is not real life, Hermione,
cut off from all the sweet home ties which bind a
happy wife with silken fetters.</p>

<p>&#8220;I pray you to send me a letter, and tell me
if <i>she</i> is less arrogant and hard to you, and if the
faith of our Lord, yet unconfessed, is growing clearer
to you. I crave to hear it is so. And now, fare you
well. I would fain greet you with a kiss. Think of
me as your friend, the happy wife of Heraclitus, and
daughter of Casca Severus.&#8221;</p>

<small>TRIUMPH.</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Hermione</span> did not live long after the reception of
this letter. She kissed it many times, and kept it safe
in the breast of her robe, never allowing any eye to
read it, never telling its contents to any mortal ear.</p>

<p>Sometimes a smile would flit over her sad face as
she pictured the bright and happy Cynthia&mdash;the child
grown into the woman, the loved and loving wife of a
brave, good man.</p>

<p>Hermione had to suffer much, and the few lines
she traced before her death, addressed to Cynthia, did
not reach Alexandria till long afterwards.</p>

<p>But they breathed of hope in the lovingkindness
of the Redeemer of the world, and told of the humble
assurance, that, like as a father pities, He had pitied
her, and would of His mercy receive her to the home
of the blest in heaven.</p>

<p>Hermione&#8217;s death was felt to be a relief by the
Vestal Maxima, C&#339;lia Concordia, who now held undisputed
sway in the Vestals&#8217; House. As we know,
she loved the power the office gave her. When Hermione
passed away, a gleam of triumph might be seen
to glance from those dark eagle-like eyes; for another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
obstacle was removed from her path, and the accomplishment
of a long cherished scheme became easier.
The priests, who had decreed that her predecessor&#8217;s
memory should be crystallised for future generations
by the laudatory lines engraved on the pedestal on
which her statue was raised, were all in their turn
consigned to the sacred Pom&#339;rium, and their names
were soon forgotten.</p>

<p>It did not deeply affect the friend of the great
Prætextatus to see the old and the feeble pass away.
She was known and admired in the highest circles of
the time at Rome; but love never seemed to come
near her or soften her proud heart.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was in the stillness of the night, when all the
Vestals but the one who watched in the temple were
sleeping, some fifteen years after the death of Hyacintha,
that the tall commanding figure of C&#339;lia Concordia
passed between the columns of the atrium, bearing
a lamp in her hand.</p>

<p>She threaded her way cautiously in the darkness,
her silver lamp casting a ray of bright light before
her. She paused at last before the statue of Hyacintha
Severa, and, waving her lamp up and down, examined
the clearly-cut noble features with a triumphant smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall thy name live?&#8221; she asked, as if addressing
the statue, &#8220;nay, thy name shall perish; if I am powerless
for aught else, I am powerful for this.&#8221; Then she
put down the lamp, and drew from the folds of her
pallium a sharp instrument. She examined the blade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
carefully, and kneeling so that she was on a level with
the pedestal, she began to scrape out the letters of the
name she hated.</p>

<p>It was no easy task, but at last it was accomplished,
and nothing but the number remained:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. XIII.&#8221; Which signified simply the order in
which the statues stood in the atrium.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thy name has perished,&#8221; she said, rising and addressing
the noble face, which seemed to answer her
bitter smile with a quiet calm beauty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thy name has perished, thy praises shall remain,
but when future generations shall ask to whom their
false flattery refers, there shall be but one answer:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. XIII.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the erasure of the name was discovered in
the light of the next morning, inquiries were made,
but without success. Various opinions were expressed,
and it was generally supposed that some one, through
wanton mischief, had erased the name.</p>

<p>At first there was a talk of re-inscribing it, but the
Vestal Maxima always found some excuses for delay,
and at length, as all who had loved her had passed
away, the subject dropped out of memory, and Hyacintha
was forgotten.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was in the reign of Constantius, in the year 357,
that the Emperor paid a visit to the ancient capital of
his empire. Julian had married Helena, and had been
accepted as Cæsar of the west, at Milan, with loud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
acclamations, while Constantius proceeded along the
Emilian and Flaminian ways, to Rome.</p>

<p>The grandeur of that procession has been described
at length, and a splendid train of nobles and
courtiers took part in it.</p>

<p>The Emperor took up his abode in the ancient
Palace of Augustus, and, we are told, presided in the
Senate, assisted at the games, and that the thirty days
he passed in the city may be described as one long
festival.</p>

<p>Delighted with his reception in Rome, and filled
with the sense of his own importance, Constantius cast
about in his mind for some suitable gift to the city,
which should eternally mark his satisfaction with it
and with himself!</p>

<p>At first, we are told that he wished to imitate the
colossal statue in the Forum of Trajan, but finally he
decided on presenting the city with the huge obelisk
which his father, Constantine, had removed from the
Temple of the Sun at Heliopolis and floated down the
Nile to Alexandria.</p>

<p>This decision gave universal satisfaction. Orders
were at once dispatched to Alexandria for the transmission
of the obelisk.</p>

<p>A ship of huge proportions and strength was provided
to convey this enormous mass of granite from
the banks of the Nile to the Tiber.</p>

<p>The command of the expedition was entrusted to
a man of high family and reputation in Alexandria,
and preparations for departure were speedily completed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>Heraclitus was seated with the parchments and
drafts before him, in his own beautiful home at Alexandria,
lost in thought, wondering if the enormous
outlay required would not exceed the expectations of
the Emperor and his officers of state, when a light
hand was laid on his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take me to Rome with thee, dear husband, I
pray thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, nay, my pretty one,&#8221; was the reply, &#8220;the
voyage may not be a quick one, thy health might
suffer, and if the huge obelisk is swamped by the way,
there will be great delay and danger to me, for I am
responsible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear husband,&#8221; said the sweet voice, &#8220;I have a
longing to see Rome. Thou knowest I went thither
as a little child, with my dear father, and nurse, and
dear good old Claudius. I pray thee, do not refuse
me my prayer. I have a dim dreamy memory of my
beautiful aunt, the Vestal Maxima, who died in the
faith of Christ. I should like to see the place where
she lived, and the spring on the Cælian Hill, where
Claudius said she looked like an angel, as she filled
her vase from the pure fountain. Dear husband, grant
my request.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had been the happy wife of Heraclitus for
some years now. Her father had died in the preceding
summer. Claudius and Anna had both passed
away, and Cynthia, who was standing with her hand
on her husband&#8217;s shoulder, urging her plea, is the
only link left with those whose lives, or rather the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
fragments of whose lives, we have followed in this
story.</p>

<p>Cynthia had known sorrow: one by one her
children had faded in their infancy, and died before
she had fully tasted the sweetness of motherhood.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the remembrance of this trouble,
which had left its trace on the fair face which was
bending over him, that made Heraclitus feel as if he
would not refuse his wife&#8217;s request.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear husband,&#8221; she pleaded, &#8220;I have but thee,
and what should I do for all the long months of thy
absence, alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My sweet one, it is a long voyage, and my mind
is so occupied with the business in hand, the arrangements,
and the responsibility which lies on my shoulders,
may so engross me, that I may seem cold and
neglectful of thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As if that could be! I will not trouble thee with
questions; let me have my own galley, and my
maidens, and thou canst come to me for solace and
comfort. Remember, dear husband, I have none but
thee to love, since God has willed that no dear little
ones should gladden my life. I am never lonely with
thee, but without thee!&#8221;</p>

<p>Heraclitus threw down his quill, and pushed the
parchments and charts aside, taking his wife on his
knee and stroking her fair head, as it rested on his
breast with a tender and gentle hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sweet wife, am I not better to thee than ten
sons? If it be God&#8217;s will that we should never see a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
child grow up, to be our pride and joy, let us recall
how many sons there are who are the curse and sorrow
of their parents&#8217; lives, and at least be thankful
we are spared such grief as that would be to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am ashamed to murmur while I have thee,&#8221;
she whispered, &#8220;but do not leave me here while thou
art gone to Rome, with that huge obelisk. It might
be a year of absence, and I feel as if I could scarcely
live without thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear wife, if I carry out this mission with success,
I may be raised to a higher rank, and give thee
many more of the luxuries and adornments of life.
But I feel I must have a mind entirely abstracted
from other matters, or I <i>may fail</i>, and then&mdash;!&#8221;</p>

<p>Cynthia sprang up, exclaiming&mdash;&#8220;Fail! nay, my
presence shall assure thy triumphant success. Let me
only come to share thy danger and difficulty, and I
am content.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sadness and depression had passed away now,
and Heraclitus looking down into his wife&#8217;s eyes, saw
in them an earnest of success.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be it so then, my sweet one&mdash;the galley shall be
prepared for thee and thy attendants. Make thy preparations,
and we will go to Rome together!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Like the faint memory of a dream the scene of
her childhood came back to Cynthia, as she presented
herself, a few months later, with two of her maidens
at the door of the Vestals&#8217; atrium. Thoughts of her
father, and of Claudius, of dear faithful Anna, to whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
hand she clung on that morning long ago, came
thronging to her heart.</p>

<p>She remembered how, when her father and Anna
led her to the room where the Vestal Maxima lay
dying, Claudius held back. The greatness of his unselfish
and unchanging love seemed to be clearer to
her now than it had ever been before&mdash;the love which
was divine in its character, the love which forgot
everything but the good of the one beloved, seemed
to present itself to the fair wife of Heraclitus, as she
stood at the gate of the Vestals&#8217; House.</p>

<p>It was yet early, and there seemed to be no one
stirring. The big heavy door was closed, and the faint
tap which Cynthia&#8217;s little slender hand made upon it
was not answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, then, lady,&#8221; exclaimed one of her maidens,
&#8220;you must rap harder than that. What a dark and
gloomy place,&#8221; she went on; &#8220;and yet you say it
is accounted an honour to be chosen a Vestal virgin.
Forsooth! I would account it an honour to be left
out of such a choice. See how the great Palace
seems to tower over us, as if it might fall and crush
us as we stand. Except for the sky above, which we
can only see by straining our necks till they are like
to break, I can hardly believe I am in the same
world as when I am in our own bright Alexandria.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cynthia scarcely heard, or heeded if she heard,
the girl&#8217;s chatter; but Portia, who was a sedate,
middle-aged woman, said, &#8220;We cannot stand here
all day; you will be over-fatigued before you enter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
this dark place, which looks like a prison.&#8221; And
Portia knocked with such good will at the door that
the sound of footsteps within was heard, and the
Vestal in charge of the outer gate or door threw it
open.</p>

<p>The Vestal was young, and answered Cynthia&#8217;s inquiries
carelessly and indifferently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I crave permission to examine the statues of the
Vestales Maximæ,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can enter, if you choose,&#8221; was the reply;
&#8220;the statues are all in the atrium.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cynthia felt chilled by her reception; and after
the brilliant light of the early day out of doors, the
atrium seemed so dark and gloomy.</p>

<p>But she passed on, and began to examine the
statues.</p>

<p>There were three or four statues of the same
Vestal Maxima, Flavia Publicia, and her praises were
on every side. Cynthia wandered about the atrium,
trying to decipher the names.</p>

<p>&#8220;Terentia Rufilla!&#8221; Cynthia read. &#8220;Ah! she was
my father&#8217;s kinswoman. It was in her time that my
aunt came hither. Cornelia Maxima! Campia Severina!
Severina! Can this be the one I seek? Ah,
no! for it is Severina, not Severa, and the year is 240;
besides, why Campia?&#8221;</p>

<p>After a long, fruitless search, Cynthia turned to
the Vestal who was following her&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;May it please you to conduct me to the presence
of the Vestal Maxima. I have a question to ask her.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>The Vestal hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, I do not know whether I may disturb her.
She is in her own apartment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say that the wife of Heraclitus, who is charged
with the safe transit of the great obelisk from Alexandria,
by the will of the Emperor, seeks information
regarding one of the statues.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Vestal shook her head, and, turning to a
severe-looking old Vestal who was passing, seemed to
refer the matter to her for decision.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, surely, the Lady Maxima must not be disturbed.
She has been watching all night, and is resting.
Who seeks her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That lady, with two attendants. She says she is
the wife of a great personage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Cynthia, with her sweet voice, accosted the
tall, severe-looking Vestal, saying, &#8220;May it please you
to tell me if I can find the statue of Hyacintha Severa,
one of the Vestales Maximæ?&#8221;</p>

<p>The dark eyes of the Vestal looked down on the
slight form of Cynthia with a penetrating glance; and,
struck with awe, Cynthia hastened to say:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Vestal Maxima was my father&#8217;s sister. I
came hither with him when a little child, of which I
have a dim memory; but my aunt was held in great
honour, and love and reverence, by my father and by
good Claudius, our friend, and I wish to see her
statue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Methinks,&#8221; said the Vestal, grimly enough, &#8220;thou
art altogether dreaming. There is one Campia Severina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
here, but I know of no Severa whose name is recorded
on the pedestals: but,&#8221; with a stately bow,
&#8220;you are free to search; the statues are all collected
here. There are duplicates of many, but I do not
know the name of which you speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the Vestal disappeared, and Cynthia, disappointed
and sad, continued her search.</p>

<p>At last one of her ladies exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is a beautiful statue, with no name; only a
number&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. XIII.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cynthia gazed up at the statue for a few moments
intensely and lovingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that must be my aunt Hyacintha,&#8221; she
said; &#8220;but oh! how dull and dismal it is here; no
sunshine, no warmth. Come, let us depart; it makes
me sad to stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ladies obeyed her not unwillingly. Rome
might be grand, and had its ancient temples and
noble statues, and its yellow, slowly-rolling Tiber;
but life was sweeter and brighter far in sunny Alexandria,
where the waves of the blue Mediterranean
danced and sparkled, and the air and light of heaven
were free to come and go.</p>

<p>As they ascended from the House of the Vestals,
and climbed the Cælian Hill, Cynthia spoke for the
first time.</p>

<p>The prospect before them was the same over which
Hyacintha Severa had so often looked, as child, and
fair maiden, and mature woman.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>&#8220;I can think of my aunt better here,&#8221; Cynthia
said, &#8220;the beautiful and the good. I feel her nearer
me here than in that dark, gloomy hall; the statue
beneath which is only written, &#8216;No. XIII,&#8217; may be her
likeness, but I love to think of her as Claudius told
me always to think of her&mdash;passed from the darkness
of earth into the Light of God, wearing the Crown of
Light, after bearing the Cross of suffering. All earthly
things fade and vanish, but that Crown fadeth not
away. Ah! I am glad I am a Christian!&#8221;</p>

<p>And now the shadow of the Great Past closes over
those whose lives, or rather the fragments of whose
lives, we have followed through long years in this
little story. The silence which throws its mantle like
a veil over the ruins of the temple and the atrium of
the Vestals cannot be broken.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The statues of the Vestales Maximæ stand like
voiceless messengers from that time of darkness&mdash;a
darkness which was, as we know, the darkness before
the dawn. In the old Rome, which is so continually
brought to the surface from the covering dust of centuries,
there can scarcely be a figure round which so
much interest might be supposed to gather as round
the nameless statue of the Vestal, whose story imagination
may supply in many colours and in many forms&mdash;each
one, for himself, as he stands before it, may
clothe it as he will. But that of the noble, earnest
soul struggling towards the Light, and rising from the
dry chrysalis of a worn-out faith to the flight of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
unimprisoned spirit upward to God&mdash;who is the Light&mdash;has
seemed as full of probability as of charm. And
it is easy to believe that a woman like C&#339;lia Concordia,
herself unable to soar and yet conscious that
her aims were after all but earthly and sordid, might
grudge one of the most beloved and most highly
gifted of the priestesses the unsparing meed of praise
which the inscription commemorates. Yet, she might
have reflected, if the inscription remained without a
name the identity of Hyacintha would never be discovered,
and thus the once-honoured and beloved
Vestal would be known henceforth only as</p>
